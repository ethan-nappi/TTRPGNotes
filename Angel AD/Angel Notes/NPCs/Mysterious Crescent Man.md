[[Science Outpost Mission]], left his coat behind on top of the [[Necronomicon]], had 6 arrows, shot at least one to a target running from the front of the outpost, left 4 in his quiver
- target unknown
- could be connected to a crescent file in [[Destiny]]'s reducation center
- definitely got the same training that Angel did
- about my size jacket
- 1 arrow missing, 1 arrow in ground, [[Angel]] collected the rest

Theory
- he was sent there to kill the operation
- he was there to learn for Destiny




So I'm connecting the dots, I have some questions 
- when we get back to Hogsback, I want to see what research papers that have those crescents
