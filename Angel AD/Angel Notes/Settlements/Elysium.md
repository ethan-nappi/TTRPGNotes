settlement pretend apoc didn't happen
every had their normal life jobs
make everything feel normal
been around since beginning
lied to everyone that it was safe
professional education

## Current State Elysium
Elysium doesn't interact with anyone cause they think they're doing it the wrong way

out of necessity, their walls, defenses, surveillence, they're the best at
Deter rather than fight EVER
