Princess came to fairies 10000 moons ago

terror covered the world
kings daughter escaped the nightmare each month toward the golden palace
the fairies palace
then she stayed
one more peaceful night and then will share it with the kingdom
moon cycle broke
she returned to the kingdom and it was lost
with tears she went back
she only wishes to have the children helped from her kingdom

"father, i am your destruction"

sophie - most recent magic cast on her
4 halflings
6 humans
1 half-orc - high innate magi,
1 goblin, kipper - high innate magi, missing baby teeth, no teeth replaced it?


[[Pleasantries]] dont want negative emotions, have to make kids numb to achieve that
negative energy manifests into nightmares
nightmares are negative energy stripped from the kids
