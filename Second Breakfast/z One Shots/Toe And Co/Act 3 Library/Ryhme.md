_See a mother scything wheat 
Lazy husband sleeping near 
With one swing she took his feet 
With another took his ear 

Does the shadow have a name? 
SHEMSHIME. 
Causes grief, avoids the blame. 
SHEMSHIME. 

See a dog that knows to heel 
Never heeds plea nor command 
Mother fed him his stale meal 
Dog chose instead to eat her hand 

Does the shadow have a name? 
SHEMSHIME. 
Causes grief, avoids the blame. 
SHEMSHIME. 

See a son doing his chore 
Washing clothes for folk in town 
Fell into the river’s roar 
Sank to the bottom and he drowned 

Does the shadow have a name? 
SHEMSHIME. 
Causes grief, avoids the blame. 
SHEMSHIME._
