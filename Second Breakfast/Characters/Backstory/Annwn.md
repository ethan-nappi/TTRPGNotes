pronounced "On-Win" (he/they)
Gul's deliverer

Tall (maybe 10ft?). Massive feathery wings that reflect the night sky. Only the lower part of his face is visible through the open mouth of a horse skull. Unnaturally long limbs. His hips and knees are jointed like a human, but the ankles and feet (hoof) are like those of a horse. He wears a soft dark gray wrapping that covers the back of his head then crosses around the front concealing neck, shoulders, arms and torso. The cloth then hangs long enough to barely touch the ground. Though the thread is all one color, the stitching has a subtle swirling pattern. His hands are human in shape, but with long spindly fingers. On the middle finger of his left hand are a twin pair of rings; the color always changes. From what can be seen of his arms when reaching out from the cloth, they are covered in similar black feathers to his wings, though not as illustrious. His legs are covered in speckled gray hair, like a horse. The skin of his face and hands is a lighter gray.

The monochromatic look makes him appear like a cut-out placed in a picture not made for him; an underpainting of values before the glazes which bring the painting to life are added.
