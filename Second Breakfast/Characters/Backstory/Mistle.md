halfling (she/they)
knows [[Sprout]] well


##### Notes on an old memory of Sprouts
last seen in the woods by Verglas through a pane of glass, Sprout didnt realize it at the time
Carriage rode up and a deal was made, the driver was eerily still
additional woman in noble-dress
traded a red relic/jewelry
Sprout was spotted
Mistle looked back at Sprout with a look that said "I have to do this, not that I want to"
(all of this was told to Silver by Sprout)
