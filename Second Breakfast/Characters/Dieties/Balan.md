Bálán (bah-lawn): The Wanderer, The Yellow Man (He/Him)

God of fortune, thresholds, crossroads, freedom, originality, curiosity, possibility, and opportunity

  

Bálán is a trickster god but always plays fair and only a fool would accuse him of cheating when fate turns against them. He commonly appears as a disheveled vagabond or beggar to strike deals and mess with fate to his amusement. He is in hiding from the other gods due to his meddlesome nature. He is just as quick to resurrect a soul as to deal out death; to bring everlasting wealth or send kingdoms into decrepitude. It is said to always be courteous to strange lonesome travelers and panhandlers because they could be Bálán in disguise.
