Maríel mar-ee-el: Woman of the Green (She/Her)
Goddess of the wilderness, hunting, navigation, stars, medicine, hope, blessings, rejuvenation, abundance, sensuality, discord, and revelry

She is a nurturer of growth; life and new ideas. To many, she is a physical and spiritual compass, steering the course of lost travelers and guiding wayward hearts. She may be kind, but she hates to be contained. Maríel sometimes loses herself in long flights of passion, stirred into a whirlwind of either jollity or wrath. 

Imagery: Stars. Migratory birds. Kites, kestrels, falcons, eagles, and hawks. Rabbit.
