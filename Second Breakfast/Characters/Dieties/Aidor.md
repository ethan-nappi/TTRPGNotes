Aídor [Eye-door]: The Shepherd (They/He/She)
Deity of the sun, childbirth, death, agriculture, travelers, artisans, success, vitality, radiance, fulfillment, and transitions

Psychopomp of souls to birth and death. They have a forge in the heart of the sun in which they craft new souls. Every day, Aídor is born, lives, then dies. Appears as a genderless child in the morning, a man in the prime of life during the day, and an old woman in the evening; the child, the youth, the crone.

Imagery: horses, wheat, sickle, fruit trees
