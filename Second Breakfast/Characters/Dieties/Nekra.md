Nekra: One Who Waits for All (They/Them)
Deity of the moon, death, transformation, endings, and fate

Writes the death of each living thing in their book. They make sure each soul goes to the proper afterlife. It is thought that Nekra’s power waxes and wanes with the phases of the large moon. While full, they see all and pass their judgment swiftly. No rest is found in the afterlife under a new moon without Nekra’s presence at the time of death.

Imagery: moon, balanced scales, water
