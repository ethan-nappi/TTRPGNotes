Gwyth: The Seeker (She/Her)
Goddess of death, knowledge, dreams, secrets, illusion, contemplation, truth, and isolation

Collector of the souls of the dead. She has tomes of knowledge from everyone who has ever died. Her emissaries gather information for her from the dead souls that they guide.  If she thinks someone has information she wants, she isn’t against gathering their soul early. It is said when Gwyth was mortal, she was seeking a specific bit of lore and she kept interrogating the souls of the dead so she could find it and wound up as a goddess of death through that process. In that scenario, some people believe that one day, Gwyth will find that bit of lore and on that day she will stop collecting the souls of the dead. Another theory is that she is trying to hide information away from an old enemy. Most think she collects knowledge for posterity’s sake. The small moon is believed to house her library.
