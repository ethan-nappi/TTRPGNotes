Broken shrine to [[Maríel]] on the way to [[Annandale]]
- 2 silver pieces
- Mugwort (substitute to incense)
- wooden doll with green ribbon
- Wooden Plaque - "_You follow a star who’s light you will never touch. The dark is the end, and the beginning of all creation. Abandon your gods. Escape the cycles. Look inward to eternity._" 
- (A thing we dont know) Gul remembered something about an old cult, knows they connect to [[Endless One Poem]] 

We fixed up the shrine and gave a small offering
A storm the next day blew away from us. We could hear [[Storm Memphits]] in the winds.
