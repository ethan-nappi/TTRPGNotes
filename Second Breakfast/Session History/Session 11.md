Tyrel traded for a pitcher of mead. (use this on the traveling trio, to maybe get more out of them, might need to buy more if Silver convinces Tyrel to drink too much.)

Silver is trying to get Tyrel drunk to maybe get him to spill details. Silver is faking drinking but Tyrel doesn't notice it. Also Silver wants to sneak off later. Gul is sleeping at the stables with Rat and the other guy who is sleeping next to his big wolf. Sprout skips drinking. Rossi is going to try to have too much.
