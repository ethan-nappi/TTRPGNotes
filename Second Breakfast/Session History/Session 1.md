The whole party met eachother at the [[Honeypot Tavern]] in [[Myerfell]] and we began the [[Save the kids]] questline. We heard word of a mage, [[Xal-Wyn]] who was knowledgeable of the Fae.

We raided [[Xal-Wyn]]'s home then left after discovering she was missing and went out the back door which teleports to the woods.
