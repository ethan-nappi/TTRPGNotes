Dreams!
Gul was visited by his psychopomp friend, shocked at Gul's current condition and situation.

Rossi had a dream of a younger version of herself with old party mates. The person Rossi played as hit the same pose as the statue in the chamber we found Xal-wyn, playing as a "hero". Dalia, was trained by her to hold her sword properly. Rossi had brown eyes and long ears in this dream. Rossi is in a room that gets flooded, seeing a tawny, bloodshot eyed elf in a mirror that grabs her trying to save her. She ended up in a chamber, the one where she found Xal-wyn. The statue in that room turned into the elf girl, cracking the symbol behind, then she woke up.

Silver and Rossi had a conversation about keeping secrets and revealed to Rossi that she detected divination and necromancy magic on Gul.

Went into town with Gul and Majesty to the couriers. Lily, Elowin (is delivering my mail), Tango.
