what

(Written on dius in the kobold cult room)
Below your feet, baleful hunger sleeps;
Dreams in the nowhere of its enmity.
Lest she be raised, crimson blood-soaked bane;
There repose the Endless One shall remain.
Without the bind of Zayanaâ€™s tome;
It will awaken and consume all known.

(accompanied by symbol of balan, twin copper snakes)
_to guard against hands wrapped in hate_
_there be no rest in Nightwind's fate_
_aid those at heart whom it is known_
_to keep malice from being grown_

we found a little stone knob on a kobold that has the eye symbol
