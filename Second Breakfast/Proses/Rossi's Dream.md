The soft wood of the toy sword is digging into your firm two-handed grip. Something hard like elm or ash wouldn’t have given you this many splinters, but a thwack from those would bruise like you wouldn’t believe, and you shouldn’t hurt your sparring partner - this is supposed to be fun you were told. At least the unpolished handle provides better purchese in your sweaty hands. You take down your opponent. You know them. They are about your age, young. But their face is blurred. The details around you just aren’t in focus. “Evil is vanquithed again!” You cry out in victory. Then grimace at the sound of your lisp, your top two front teeth fell out a couple days ago, they’d been wiggling loose for awhile. The kid in front of you stands and dusts off their behind. “Why am I always the villain, again?”
“Because,” a voice sounds to your left - a young girl - another of your friends, “heroes should be the ones who win, and you always loose. If she was the villain, catastrophe! She beats you every time!”
The girl then puts on an heir of exaggerated decorum, Fixing the flower crown that suddenly comes into focus - dandelions you realize - atop her head.
“Approach warrior! And kneel before me!”
You lower yourself to both knees, head bowed, dark tan hands on the pommel of your sword with its tip to the ground.
Your friend places a hand on top of your head, it’s warm like rays of the sun. “I name thee Hero of the realm, protector of all that is good!”
“You can’t actually do that,” comes the irritated voice behind you.
“By the -” she cuts herself off angrily, “it’s just pretend you dingbat!”
Hero… protector of all that is good? It’s just a game, but the idea sends a thrill up your spine and a nervous swirl of your stomach. A responsibility and honor like that is difficult to achieve.
But the girl takes one of the yellow flowers from her crown and tucks it behind your long ear and your other friend picks up their sword, ready to go again with a gap-toothed smile that breaks through the blur of features, so you correct your thoughts. Not difficult at all, when all that is good is standing right in front of you.
You look down at the sword in your hands, assessing whether it can take another beating again. The fabric wrapped around the sharp metal is coming a bit loose. It’ll hold for now.
“Am I holding this right?”
Wherever - whenever - you are, the sun is bright and strong. Sweat causes the fabric of your shirt to cling to your back, and the owner of this new voice is definitely not holding it right and the sight pulls forth a feeling of amused and exasperated affection.
You can now describe your own response as Rossi, and you continue Anna, knowing this person is [redacted].
… 
“Come-on, let’s go get cleaned up inside!”
You look into the mirror at the washbasin, youthful brown eyes gazing back. You have a smudge of dirt on your cheek. You turn your attention to the basin, cleaning away the blood. Catching a glance back up in the mirror, something looks off. The color of your eyes… they’re not quite brown anymore, no. The difference is subtle, but, yes there’s definitely something wrong. Just a few touches too dark.
After a moment of staring you pull your hands out of the red-dyed water. Drying them on the front of your shirt, but leaving no smear of blood behind. The wounds on your hands are closed.
Movement in front of you catches your attention.
A tawny elf is reflected back at you, long limp coal-dark hair, and wild blood-shot eyes, reminding you of obsidian; deep, dark and sharp. Her mouth is moving, speaking words but no sound reaches you. She stops trying to speak and places a hand on the mirror. Waiting. Staring imploringly.
All the while water overflows from the washbasin and covering the floor too quickly. Your socks are wet.
She presses harder on the glass. Forming cracks. The water is flooding her side too, reaching both your chests.
The surge of water swells over both your heads. She darts her hand forward breaking through the glass and grasps your hand. She has a firm grip. Both of you share the calloused hands of a swordsman.
Your feet rise, and the two of you float horizontally in the liquid. You can see but all is tinted red from an unknown source of light. It makes the the world look like an ocean of blood.
There is a rush as the liquid pulls away from you like water down a drain. You and she are carried into the depths. You are momentarily disoriented as you are deposited on a stone cold floor.
Taking a glance around, you recognize the chamber you and the rest of your party had found and rescued Xal-Wyn. On hands and knees, you stare at the looming statue; the elven knight—knees on the dias, head bowed, hands on the pommel of a greatsword with its tip to the ground. The head whips up, stone hair falling from the face; obsidian eyes set in stone. 
You wake up.
