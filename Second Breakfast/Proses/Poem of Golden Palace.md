Once upon a time, a swarm of terror descended over the world under cover of a wine-dark sky.

Blood stained the kingdom red while rulers argued and people panicked.

The king’s daughter ([[Felecia]]) escaped from the nightmare each month into a beautiful dream, walking through a field of yellow flowers toward a palace so much like her own but brilliant and bejeweled.

Then, for the first time she stayed in one of the soft beds of her new home and thought to herself before sleep took her, ‘One more peaceful night, then I will share my paradise with all the children of my kingdom. Let our mothers, fathers, watchers and wardens keep the land they broke.’

But low! When the young girl returned under the blue light of the full moon, she found her kingdom long abandoned.

The verde of the land had since claimed ownership of the brick and mortar of her lost kingdom.

So, the princess's tears stained her white robes when she turned away and went back to the land of her dreams, hoping to forget.
