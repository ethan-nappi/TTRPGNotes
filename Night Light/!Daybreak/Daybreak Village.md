A village built on trust and hope, Daybreak village maintains the most tightly knit community of people [[Noctice]] has ever seen. 

Those who reside in Daybreak Village commit themselves to providing to the village in any manner. There's no room for selfishness here and the village's survival is dependent on everyone who resides there. 

Daybreak is built on the back of [[Oria]], a large [[Sol Beast]] who provides all around protection for its residents. In return, the village provides for any of Eos' needs, which usually consists of eating a large amount of fruits.
