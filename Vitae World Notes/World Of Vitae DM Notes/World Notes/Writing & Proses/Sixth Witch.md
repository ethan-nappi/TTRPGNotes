_(Nursery Rhyme)_

_Hang one up for dragon's sake,  
Hang the lass with devil horns,  
Hang all those of Lux's hate,  
Hang the ones who follow scorn.  
You'll sleep now and you'll sleep tight,  
You must stay in for the night,  
If you're seen out in the moon,  
The sixth witch hung might just be you.  

(3rd verse found only in [[Vallar]])  
Take down the lass in the night,  
Don't tell your friends of the sight,  
Just know her bump is a myth,  
Or you might become the sixth.
