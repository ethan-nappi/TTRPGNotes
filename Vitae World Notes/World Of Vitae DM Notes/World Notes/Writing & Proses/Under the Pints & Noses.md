(Song)

Under the dusty filthy bar  
Sits the boys of the silent clan  
Clad in dark clothes, swords in their sheaths  
Drinks passed below, their undertow  
Know that the boys are more than safe  
No one stays up later than they  
the ones clothed head to toe in greys  
They gamble all but their next day  
  
Under the pints and noses of us  
Lies the worst or so we thought  
Watch out when the stairs start creakin'  
You'd truly need to run from them  
Blazed drunk singer, a tired father  
Wealthy shortmen, homeless conmen,  
Men of two swords, angry are few  
Bounty on them for they've committed crimes  
Under the pints and noses of us  
  
Came walking in on a sunny  
A large crew who looked real funny  
Asking for a good time or two  
Nothing ever seemed less askew  
They went down the stone stairs in back  
Of us in the bar no one wiser  
Until we never heard from the boys  
For guess where the crew had killed them  
  
Under the pints and noses of us  
Lies the worst or so we thought  
Watch out when the stairs start creakin'  
You'd truly need to run from them  
A brown pack mule, bookworm singer,  
Lady pirate, law abider,  
Two flaming swords and a bad brute,  
Bounty on them for they had killed them  
Under the pints and noses of us
