The Peace Treaty of Vitae for Dragons and All is a document that finally brought an end to the conflicts between dragons and humanoids. Written primarily by [[Yutalajar]] of Dragons and King [[Kyvar Navari]] of Humanoids, the document details a number of terms that both parties must abide to or otherwise conflicts will ensure once more. It resulted in dragons leaving [[Vida Yang]] for good, only sometimes showing back up in the [[Dragon Valley]]

The current location of the peace treaty is in [[Dracona]]. It is written once in Draconic and once in Common, however numerous duplicates exist for the sake of accurate record keeping for if something ever happened to the originals. The original is kept in a secret location in [[Dracona]]

In order for a city or town to be recognized as official by other settlements then they must agree to all terms of this treaty and must be prepared to deliver the punishments necessary in the event of conflict or crime.

# The Document "Peace Treaty of Vitae for Dragons and All"
#### Handling of Further Conflict
Dependent on the importance of the individuals involved, the punishment for the offender shall be scaled to match the crime active immediately after trials if trials are necessary. Those defending themselves from such crimes receive no punishment if options were limited.
When referring to "strikes," the document means that any act committed against the being with the intent to harm the being by whatever means necessary that doesn't kill the being.  
  
- A commoner or wyrmling that strikes the other shall remain imprisoned or exiled for a year. 
- A guardsman or young dragon striking the other or lesser shall remain exiled from the current settlement of residence for 3 years, and a guardsman would lose all ability to become a guard again in any humanoid settlement.
- A knight, noble, or adult dragon striking the other or lesser shall remain exiled from all settlements for 3 years or greater. The knight would lose his knighthood and a noble his status. 
- A knight, noble, or adult dragon shall also become an outcast to their families or clans as if they weren't ever a part of it to begin with even after the exile is over. Those who assist the knight, noble, or dragon shall be treated the same.
- A ruler or ancient striking the other or lesser, or ordering that strike shall be force to give up any power currently possessed to the next in line and must be exiled from all settlements for 10 years or greater. 
- The death of a wyrmling or commoner results in eternal exile.  
- The death of a guardsmen or young dragon results in execution.  
- The death of a knight, noble, or adult, results in execution and the potential reevaluation or disbandment of their associated organization.
- The death of a ruler or ancient results in an isolated war between the two factions that cannot receive aid from any outside factions until an agreement of justice is agreed upon.  

If justice is not served for any of the crimes then the treaty may result in being void if another form of justice cannot be agreed upon.

#### Rightful Territories
Territories in which the dragons and the humanoids can form civilizations in shall remain split for as long as this treaty stands. Humanoids such as dwarves, aarakocra, humans, halflings, etc. on the continent of [[Ise Yen]] shall be brought to [[Vida Yang]] permanently. Dragons are to keep their civilizations over in Ise Yen and humanoids to keep theirs on Vida Yang. After the first year of peace, anything that remains in either of the territories belongs to the beings that inhabit that land. The water and isles in between that aren't connected to the mainlands are not included in the two territories. [[Alma Yin]] and other lands besides Vida Yang and Ise Yen are not allowed to be claimed as territory for humanoids nor dragons.

#### Reparations
Both humanoids and dragons needed reparations to set each-other back on the right tracks. Trade and labor was shared between the two sides. Humanoids, received a lot of help from dragons in transporting large shipments of rock, game from hunters, whales for fishermen, and other heavy lifting that would be expensive for people. Humanoids also received a lot in magical items from the collections dragons had to part ways with as it would've been too much of a hassle to transport over an ocean. On the other hand, humanoids pooled together over the first year of peace a quarter ton worth of gold and platinum pieces, another quarter ton of gems and jewels, and constructed an array of tools and instruments for magical research.
