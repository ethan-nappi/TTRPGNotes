(Song)
*by [[Elizabeth Garrison]]*

I can't think of, a time without, without my one, lovely sister, 
For if I did not, have my sister, My heart would be, so very cold, 
I can't think of, a time without, without her there, by my poor side, 
She rescues me, from me being, oh so lonely, she rescues me,
 
I feel golden, a golden girl, no blue, no blue, A girl by Rose, a girl of gold, of gold, gold, gold,
 
Kitan has women, finest you'll see, Brown blonde black white, 
but there's just one Of red twisted hair, how could you miss, 
Men and women, caught by her spell, She has a name, 
the next to our current queen, Eldest sister, just before me, 
come say with me, lets make her hear, her name from here, her name's Roseanne,
 
We feel golden, golden we are, too of blue, too of white, A girl named Rose, a girl of gold, of gold, gold, gold,
 
Oh my dear Rose, Oh how you've grown, I want you to, want you to know, I love you so, my dearest Rose, You make me feel, you make me feel, like gold, we're gold
