#SeaShanty

_(Bold is to be sung together by the crew)  
How high, how high, **do the seas go,**  
The tide, the tide, **she's comin close,**  
For the seas have no friends nor foes,  
So we must stick together lads,  
Blue green waves are a fearsome one,  
That may take some of us to death,  
But with drinks swords hands legs and us,  
**Ain't nowhere that us lads can't go,  
How high, how high, do the seas go,  
The tide, the tide, she's comin close,  
But with our drinks and hands and legs,  
Ain't nowhere that us lads can't go!**
