Dragon tamers are individuals with the innate magic to control dragons like the gods. Dragon tamers are able to control one type of dragon associated with a certain god. Additionally they can only control one dragon at a time this way. 

The process of making a dragon tamer is unknown to even the highest of arcanists and acolytes, however it was pieced together by [[Te-Guid|Te-Guid]] that each god has it's own process for making something a dragon tamer. The only discoverable process is by avatars, deities, Te-Guid, and [[Nook]] when she's 15.
