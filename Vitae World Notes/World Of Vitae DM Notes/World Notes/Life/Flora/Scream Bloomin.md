## Description
Flowers that have mouth-like openings at the top of their stem covered by red, black, or maroon petals that when disturbed will scream for a few seconds before remaining open for a number of hours before closing again. The saliva-like droplets that come out after a scream contain substances that activate seeds implanted in the roots of the flower.
