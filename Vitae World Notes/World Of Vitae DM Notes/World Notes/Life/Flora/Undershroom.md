## Growth
The undershroom undergoes three stages. The first stage it appears as a normal brown, grey, or black mushroom sprout but is headless. About one month in, the second stage in which it is most commonly seen in it will grow its head and start to glow in a shade of blue. This emits a small amount of light that creates dim light in a five foot radius around it. After an undetermined amount of time, its third stage initiates and it has reached the end of its lifespan, its head will fall off and the sprout will lose its glow and wither. Afterwards the head will decompose and also lose its glow but will grow two or three more mushrooms in the spot of the head after decomposition.

## Habitat
It can only be found in low-light conditions. As long as it can still illuminate the area around it it will stay alive even when unrooted. If any light blots out its own, it will start to wither and will not grow a new mushroom in its place.

It's other needs for growth is still unknown.
