Flowers that bloom on a full moon that have a small glow that reaches out to a few feet surrounding it. The center of the flower resembles that of a moon with craters, each flower having a unique pattern in the center. These flowers will always bloom in the Faewild and in the ethereal plane no matter the time. They can be found in areas around the [[Sylriver Delta]] and in [[Bamguard Forest]].Â
