## Appearance
Boofers in most ways resemble that of a typical wolf. They get their name from their unusually deep bark and incredible vocal range. The primary differences that make them distinct from wolves are the size and fur density. They are eight feet in body length although have been recorded to reach ten feet in captivity with a healthy lifestyle. Their fur is less soft than a typical wolf but is much more dense and thick. They have also been shown to show incredible feats in strength and proven to be great animal companions, especially for combat (see Diet).

#### Unique Fur Properties
Boofer fur contains an interesting property that lets the boofer resist the cold further. A magnification of the fur reveals that there are small pockets within each hair that catches fallen ice or snow. It is believed that the boofer evolved this way to prevent particles getting stuck beneath its fur. A simple shake or brush and these particles fall right out of the fur.

## Behavior
Boofers unlike wolves don't use pack tactics to hunt their prey and often find and finish prey on their own. They're also omnivorous, showing no issues with eating a diet that contains berries.

## Habitat
Boofers prefer colder climates although can still survive in warmer ones with enough places that provide shade. During the winter months, boofers can be seen anywhere in Vida where snow can be found although are much rarer to find out of the mountains.
