These creatures native only to the [[Ropswamp]] outside of [[Popsra]] aren't as cute as the name might suggest. These wretched monsters that terrorize those who wish to live around the Ropswamp. They should never be messed with.
## Appearance
These creatures with sheep faces that have mouths like an alligator, the eyes of a snake, the horns of a devil, the legs of large spiders, and drooping, thick, matted fur, stained with the grime and moss of the Ropswamp, should never be messed with. 

## Behavior
They hunt in massive herds of 20 to 60 other sheep. The main strategy of the pack is to find prey and circle around them, taking one bite for each sheep and quickly rolling away. Rolling sheep do not care whether or not they leave their prey alive after a biting spree. Their legs while moving, look as if they're kicking at the ground, tumbling on their sides up to 15 feet per second.
