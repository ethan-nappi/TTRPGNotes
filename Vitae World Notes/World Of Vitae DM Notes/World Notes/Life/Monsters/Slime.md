# Behavior

Slimes are aggressive to other creatures by nature. They keep to themselves or within packs, depending on the type of slime and their situation. A slime should never be approached unless a tool to capture the slime is nearby.
# Biology

Slimes are most often made up of a fluid like substance with an out membrane made of the same material. Exceptions to this are metallic slimes that make a shell or armor out of their metallic components.

Slimes have a digestive system that consists of intaking specific kinds of materials, breaking them down to molecular parts, then producing waste that results in a "sump" of the parts.
# Ecology

Slimes are found throughout [[Vitae]], most often where there's nearby body of water, mud, or cave system. Slime don't stray too far away from the location they're created in and will only travel if seeking a new source of sustenance. 
# Uses

Slimes are typically harvested for their sumps and their outer membranes.
