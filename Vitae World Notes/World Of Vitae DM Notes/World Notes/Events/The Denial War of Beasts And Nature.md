The Denial War of Beasts and Nature (often shortened to Denial War) was a war was fought by those who stood under the leadership of Humankind versus creatures under Airda's influence, the Airdic Army. In the final years of the ending of the war against dragons and for many years after the Dragon Peace Treaty was signed, nature fought to become the new rulers of the continent over the dragons as were Humankind.

## TIMELINE

### Prelude
The wars started within the century before the dragon rule had ended. It is unclear when exactly the Airdic army was being to rise and gain influence but it is known that [[Reprimir Vortivund]], the druidic leader of the ancient orc city [[Huet-Rosenvyne]] (Hue-t Rose-N-veen) rose into power in 50 DR. Reprimir Vortivund was the eldest son of King [[Gevend Vortivund]], making him the heir to Huet-Rosenvyne. At birth, King Gevend performed an ancient ritual on Reprimir that was once said to have been delivered from Airda herself onto early practicers of druidcraft which has long been lost to time and destroyed by the end of the Denial War. He received the best druidic training available at the time, often training directly in the sylvan pool of Huet. 

### Airdic Rise
Soon after Reprimirs crowning, he pulled the city out from Humankind, claiming that it wouldn't be necessary for them in the coming years. Reprimir went across the land in that time with his four apostles to spread their influence to creatures of all kinds, those who were particularly susceptible to magic charms. This consisted of primarily beasts and drakes. 

### Airdic Fall
The Airdic Army hadn't stayed strong for long. Soon after 43 ADP, [[League of Vida Yang]] was able to focus its military efforts away from ridding dragons and focusing it at the heart of the Airdic Army. In 104 ADP, Reprimir was slain, but his armies and apostles remained afterwards for some time until 120 ADP when the army was no longer considered a real threat and was believably diminished. A bigger force was discovered to be pulling the strings on Reprimir after the war came to a close.  A few archived notes from an extraplanar being suggested an avatar from Airda was controlling Reprimir to some degree, even suggesting Reprimir may have even been offered greater power for the souls of all of his followers near the time of his death. The only faction of the Airdic army that still stands is the Vaquan faction deep within the sea but none of ventured enough to fully understand the nature of the Vaquan.

## AIRDIC ARMY
The Airdic Army was comprised of a number of factions guided by Airda with the same purpose. Their purpose was to take down or take over leadership of large cities and of [[League of Vida Yang]] to secure leadership over the continent of [[Vida Yang]]. Here are a list of factions commonalities between creatures:
-   Draki - Comprised of Green dragons, drakes, wyverns, and many lesser dragon beasts
-   Pelantine - awakened plant life
-   Vaquan - a force of undersea humanoids discovered during the war
-   Kobolds - humanoids that originated from a failed draconic mutation, forced under the earth for their unfortunate nature
-   Carniki - creatures that either resembled beasts, were mutated/unmutated beasts, or dire beasts
-   Separatists - humanoids, often druids, who opposed letting [[League of Vida Yang]] giving rule to humanoids
-   Celestials - creatures sent from the heavens by Airda or Deair
