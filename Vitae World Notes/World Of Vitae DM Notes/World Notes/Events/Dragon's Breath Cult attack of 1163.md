In the early morning of Ari 27, 1163, the day of the attack, Rosanne was brought back to Kitan safe and sound by a band of adventurers and by Elizabeth. Only minutes after her rescue was when the attack initiated. The attack lasted over the course of the next five days, although the last day the battle was already won by Kitan. King [[Elric Garrison]] and Queen [[Tellina Garrison-Windire]] as well as a number of other members of the royal family were slain. Elizabeth is a notable survivor.

He is currently there assisting her on how to rule a city. The reasons for Rosanne's capture and the attack are still unknown.
