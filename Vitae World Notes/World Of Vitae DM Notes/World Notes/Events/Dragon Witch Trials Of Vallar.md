Military action. The hanging of several [[Dragon's Breath Cult|Dragon's Breath]] Cultists in [[Vallar]]. The first targeted attack on the cult.

---

The Dragon Witch Trials happened in 1153 ADP. Authorities noticed a raise in activity with the cultists, particularly the delivering of illegal magical components associated with conjuration. A number of cultists were arrested and interrogated for answers as to what the components were for. There was never a direct answer.  

After repeated threats from Vallar's military to stop their operation and disband the organization, Vallar captured and hung important figures within the cult in the city square.   
  
Unofficial reports say that after the hangings, one of the victims, a tiefling female had been taken down only a few hours after while the others remained for a few days.    
  
Victims of the attack include:

-   Maverin Freagon - Bronze Dragonborn Male, 34
-   [[Celare Natalis]] - Tiefling Female, 24
-   Arindo E'ara - Elven Male, 175
-   Gortholdo Olloo - Human Male, 18
-   Hevry Smittsen - Human Male, 21
