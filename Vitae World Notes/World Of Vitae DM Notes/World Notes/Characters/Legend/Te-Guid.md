## SUMMARY

Te-Guid Firae, often just referred to by his first name Te-Guid, was a tiefling scientist, historian, and researcher that made great strides to figure out the secrets of Vitae who was discovered to have hailed from an encampment where [[ShardensVale]] now stands, although moving to [[Silvaya]] very early in his life. He's responsible for founding the ritual to cross over to the [[Faewild]] (see crossing ritual) and was the first to step into the land without the means of arcane teleportation. However, one day Te-Guid vanished, never to return.  
Nobody truly knew about his last whereabouts as he never really kept close friends and more had allies he asked for favors from often in exchange for his research findings. It is rumored that Te-Guid was working on a set of three books in which would contain an immense sum of his findings, keeping a certain theme with each one, however few ever knew if the books were created.

The names of his books:
- [[Vitae Completium I]]
- [[Vitae Completium II]]
- [[Vitae Completium III|Vitae Completium III/Sacred Secrets and Magic]]
