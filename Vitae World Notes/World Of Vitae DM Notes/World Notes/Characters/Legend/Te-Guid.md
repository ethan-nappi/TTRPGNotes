## SUMMARY

Te-Guid Firae, often just referred to by his first name Te-Guid, was a tiefling scientist, historian, and researcher that made great strides to figure out the secrets of Vitae who was discovered to have hailed from an encampment where [[ShardensVale]] now stands, although moving to [[Silvaya]] very early in his life. He's responsible for founding the ritual to cross over to the [[Faewild]] (see crossing ritual) and was the first to step into the land without the means of arcane teleportation. However, one day Te-Guid vanished, never to return.  
Nobody truly knew about his last whereabouts as he never really kept close friends and more had allies he asked for favors from often in exchange for his research findings. It is rumored by Te-Guid's towerkeepers that he was working on a series of tomes that would act as the culmination of his knowledge of Vitae as he knows it.

The names of his books:
- [[Vitae Completium I]]
- [[Vitae Completium II]]
- [[Vitae Completium III|Vitae Completium III/Sacred Secrets and Magic]]

## The Disappearance

Te-Guid went missing around 7ADP. To this day there isn't a single clue as to where he went next. However, secretly contained with the Completiums is a message that tells what his plans are.

The gods discovered what Te-Guid was doing, and after the dragons were forced off the continent, the gods wanted to slow the revolution of people. After coming to an agreement, with the assistance of [[Nox]]'s dark magic, [[Truco]] sent down an avatar, the greatest assassin, [[Uzbarador]], to take down Te-Guid. Masked as a towerkeeper, [[Uzbarador]] snuck up to Te-Guid and stabbed him through the heart. However, Te-Guid's paranoia from the days of the Dragon Rule kept him alive. Previously constructed sensors, glyphs, and a ring of feign death tricked even the god of trickery. [[Vada]] and [[Almes]] themselves arrived to his room shortly after to retrieve his body and soul. He was brought to [[Crea's Rest]], a graveyard within the astral plane where the gods hide their mistakes among the [[Noxmares]] to keep it safe.

## Time in the Astral

Te-Guid woke up centuries after. His necklace was not only inscribed incorrectly, but time dilation within the astral plane played with the magic of his necklace and distorted it's duration greatly. The grave keepers of [[Crea's Rest]] were stunned by his awakening but Te-Guid was quick to get on their good side. It would take time but he would discover a magical scar left within him from the gods (his weakness?). He'd work close with the people of the Astral, hiding his identity and completing the Completiums to hide from the gods on the plane they would expect it the least, Vitae. The Completiums are undetectable by magic, even from the gods, not even he knows where his books are anymore.
