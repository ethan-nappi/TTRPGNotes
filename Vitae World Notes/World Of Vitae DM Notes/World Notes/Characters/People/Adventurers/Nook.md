# "The Dark Child"
A ten year old girl who never had the chance to have a normal childhood. Orphaned, hunted, and bullied, Nook wishes for a moment of normalcy.

The bearer of a powerful book of magic, the [[Vitae Completium III]], the one destined to tame the first sighted purple dragon, and a fan of all things purple, Nook, at only age 10, has a long strange life ahead of her.

## Appearance

###### PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION
Thin and weak but dexterous for her age.

###### BODY FEATURES
Nook has the typical features tieflings do. She has two horns on her head that pull to the back of her head, long pointed ears, and pink skin. Her tail has a slight heart shape at the end but also fades to a purple at the tip from the base of her tail. Her skin as well in some areas contain patches of particularly rough skin that provide a natural armor for her.

###### FACIAL FEATURES
Her irises are purple but a close inspection reveals two threads of gold on either eye.

###### PHYSICAL QUIRKS
When Nook gets angry her eyes glow a solid purple, the same color as her Iris.

###### APPAREL & ACCESSORIES
She wears a lightweight bright purple dress with layered fabrics at the bottom and loose sleeves, a white obi adorned with a bow, white scarf, leather backpack, black leggings, and slightly over-sized winter boots.

## Capability
Nook is a [[Dragon Tamer]], potentially the only one in [[Vitae]].
## Mentality
###### EDUCATION
Most of Nook's education comes from [[Nawvel]] and is also from self teaching. Nawvel sat with her in the orphanage teaching her some of the things he was learning in school until she could attend it herself. She was always above her grade level in learning but scored low on tests due to the mental strain of bullying from classmates. She left before the end of her second year and stuck solely to self-teaching.  
   
Currently she learns the basic subjects herself and recieves deeper, more thorough teaching in the arcane and science from Nawvel.  
   
Nook also teaches herself fighting techniques with her dagger and crossbow in case anything ever goes awry.


###### ACCOMPLISHMENTS
Although currently too young, she has received recommendations from Nawvel to the [[Aspirit Guild]], a guild she looks to join.


###### MENTAL TRAUMA
Nook has endured much bullying from children at the orphanage and in school as well as discrimination from shopkeeps and guardsmen.


###### INTELLECT
Nook is an incredibly quick learner and it is unsure if this has anything to do with her odd draconic bloodline. She is also almost supernaturally charismatic.


###### MORALITY & PHILOSOPHY
Nook was taught by [[Nawvel]] and the books she read as a kid to be good, although she's still figuring it all out.


###### KNOWN LANGUAGES
Nook can speak a number of languages thanks to [[Nawvel]]. She can speak: Dwarvish, Draconic, Infernal, ████, and Common


## Personality

###### LIKES & DISLIKES
Nook loves to learn about the world, history, the arcane, dragons, and any subject she hasn't tapped into yet. Nook also loves the colors purple and pink.  
   
Nook doesn't have any particular dislikes.

###### VIRTUES & PERSONALITY PERKS
Despite enduring a lot of hardship, Nook can keep a calm exterior and can brush off little troubles, staying optimistic when all is well.  
   
She remains very curious, asking many questions and wanting to get into the tiny details of things.  
   
She's yet to have bound herself to any code, so she'll go with any idea or plan that doesn't involve harm to anyone.

###### VICES & PERSONALITY FLAWS
Nook more often than not will keep to herself and won't speak when there's an issue. She is still very unsure of how to deal with her emotions, letting them bottle up and eventually quickly letting it all go in an explosive manner if not resolved.  
   
Nook also cannot bring herself to hurt a dragon, even when it attacks her.  
   
Due to her age, she can also be easily influenced by what goes on around her, potentially leading her to pick up on bad behaviors.

## Social
###### CONTACTS & RELATIONS
Growing up in the [[Vallar Home of Orphans]], Nook grew very attatched to [[Erina Friya]], a caretaker who spent a lot of time looking after Nook. 

Nook also grew up alongside [[Nawvel]] seeing him almost as an older brother, though totally unrelated to eachother. She treats him as a close friend and mentor. Being the only two tieflings in the orphanage, Nook stayed close to him, following his example in an environment that still mistreats tieflings.

###### MANNERISMS
Nook's speech fluctuates a lot with her mood and with who she's talking to. She adapts quickly to match the mannerisms of who she's speaking to, sometimes mimicking posture and hand motions. Generally, she is very expressive.

###### ENEMIES
[[Dragon's Breath Cult]]
