## MENTAL CHARACTERISTICS

### Personal history

_(For clarity, Dink Dink IV will be referred to as just Dink Dink throughout this paragraph.)_ Dink Dink grew up in the mansion that houses the [[Dink family]]. The Dink family is known well for their long running and extremely successful family winery, [[Dink's Drinks]]. Growing up, as is tradition in the family, Dink Dink knew he would inherit a powerful spot and eventually ownership of the winery would belong to him. Currently the winery is still owned by his great grandfather, Dink Dink the First, who is soon to pass it down to his son, Dink Dink II. You can guess the name of Dink Dink's father. However Dink Dink didn't have the same asperations as the other Dink Dinks and left late into his teenage years. It is unclear how, but Dink Dink soon arrived in Tiny Hut, faking his age to make his way into the guard of Tiny Hut. Dink Dink resides there now has the captain of the guard and renowned druid among Tiny Hut.  

### Saving Hai-Eaght

Some time in 1162 ADP Dink Dink's career as a regular guardsman, a famed bard and windsinger from Daleton came into the settlement, [[Hai-Eaght]]. Although Hai-Eaght doesn't like talking about why he went there in the first place, Dink Dink has revealed that he was "looking for a change of scenery." After some time in the settlement, strangely a green wyrmling dragon began lurking around the town. It was known only for a short time by the guard before it finally attacked random inhabitants of the settlement, most notably Hai-Eaght. Dink Dink happened to be the first to respond, saving Hai-Eaght from the attack. It's unclear whether or not they were friends before this attack but it's very clear now that they're very close with each other, having a very tight and small social circle.
