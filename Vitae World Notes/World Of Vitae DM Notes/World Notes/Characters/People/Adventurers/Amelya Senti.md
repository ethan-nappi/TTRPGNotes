# "Angel Of Antor"
> *"Oh please, 'angel' is a bit much. Amelya of Antor is just fine."*
> *Amelya,* after slaying the "[[White Death]]"

Amelya Senti is a prominent human monster hunter in the town of [[Antor]], the town she was born in. At age 8 to due her parents passing away, she became a student to a mage in [[Volcandor]], [[Brice O'Vern]] who studied the history and runes of giants. One day after Brice's disappearance, she went back to Antor and used her knowledge of runes to imbue her weapons andrmor to protect her town. She earned the title "Angel of Antor" after killing the beast that took the lives of her parents and many others in Antor every winter. 

### Physical Description

Amelya has medium length blonde hair setup into a bob, separate scars on her left eyebrow, lip, and nose, and has a distinct blue and red tattoo on her left forearm that is the "dragonmark of the sentinel." Loosely the tattoo looks like a depiction of a dragon with barriers surrounding it. Amelya is typically seen in her combat wear which consists of a red hoodless leather cowl as well as a leather breast piece over a heavy chain shirt with armored boots and padded pants. In her casual attire she drops the armor and wears a cut sleeveless top and loose pants, adding a heavy red cloak only during the winter. Almost everywhere she goes she carries her longsword but carries a greatsword as well when in combat wear. 

## Personal History

### Growing Up In Antor

Amelya was born and raised in the town of Antor. Her father, [[Hendrick Senti]], was a dock guard and her mother, [[Petra Senti-O'Vern]], was an herbalist. She attended a local school that gave a basic education and for the most part lived a normal life, sometimes getting fighting lessons form her father and playing around with her mother's herbs. Amelya also has an older sister [[Kay Senti]]. At around age 8, a winter rolled around and a terrible beast known as the "[[White Death]]" came around, terrorizing the town by hunting those who strayed too far out into the woods. It was a winter wolf that was difficult to track and was presumed to be the alpha of his pack. On an herb gathering walk, both Hendrick and Petra were slain by the beast. In a will found at the home, it said that if anything were to happen to the parents that both Kay and Amelya would be sent to live with other family members. Kay to stay with her uncle Jone Senti in [[Kitan]], and Amelya to stay with [[Brice O'Vern]] in [[Volcandor]] , her uncle. 

### Time With Brice

Amelya worked as a mostly a cleaner and [[mage-maiden]] for Brice who studied the history and runes of giants, occasionally dabbling and picking back up the work of Petra in herbalism brewing and selling natural health potions to make money for his research. Brice occasionally took Amelya to sites by Kitan where ruins of giants lay unexplored, but this wasn't until Amelya was aged 11. At around the same time she got to play around with the runes that Brice was studying, putting them on training swords and occasionally breaking a bookshelf or stone on accident. At age 12 Brice had started paying for her to get fighting lessons. Amelya expressed her anger about her parents death one day to Brice, asking if she could use the runes to one day to slay the beast to avenge them, he denied allowing her to do so. Shortly after she turned 14, Brice went missing after going on an expedition alone to a ruin near the volcano of Volcandor. After waiting almost a month for him to return and city guards couldn't find out where he'd went, Amelya collected the her belongings and took Brice's research and coin, selling off whatever she could of his supplies and mailed ownership of the facility to the only family she could contact in Kitan. Amelya decided on travelling back to Antor with enough of Brice's research to figure out how to imbue her weapons with the giant's runes. 

### "Angel of Antor"

On her way back from [[Volcandor]] Amelya was ambushed by a group of bandits known as the "[[White Devils]]" who tried stealing everything she was bringing back from Antor. What the bandits weren't ready for was the incredible swords skill Amelya had which caused them to quickly retreat from her, taking only some gold in the process. After reporting the incident to the Antor guard, the attackers were identified by the scars left by the longsword and arrested, reducing the bandit's activity. Not too long afterwards Amelya looked to the town's notice board seeking contracts that could use a swordsman like her. Overtime, notices for bodyguards or extra hands for hunting and gathering showed up, however were limited seeing as how Amelya was still only 14. Nonetheless, she gained some experience when going out gathering, often being a huge help doing work that required lifting heavy game. In the Winter of 1163, the "White Death" came back for the first time since she left and Amelya wasn't going to let it kill more of Antor's citizens. Guardsmen told her to stay out of the action repeatedly but she refused. One day during a blizzard she was patrolling a neighborhood when she heard a little girl scream. Amelya was spotted later laying unconscious after the little girl went to get help. According to the girl, Amelya had taken a blow from the wolf for her and fought the wolf until she made it to safety. The town praised her actions after providing her the best treatment they could. The activity of the "White Death" halted for the rest of that winter. She was the talk of the town for quite some time afterwards, being offered better guarding contracts and a few times being called upon by the guard for work. In the Winter of 1164, the "White Death" came back once again. Setting out with some of the guard, they went to go track down the alpha wolf to hopefully put an end to it's killing. After some time of going out into the forest, Amelya slipped down into a cave covered by snow, shockingly sticking the landing and not injuring herself on the way down. She told the guard she'd look for another exit and to setup a rope in the mean time. Not long after the alpha wolf met her in the cave and the two fought. Amelya got the final blow, ending the beasts terror. She was rescued minutes later when they got a rope long enough to allow her to climb back up. Back in the town Amelya was praised again for her work on combating the beast, earning the title "Angel of Antor," although she prefers to go by "Amelya of Antor."
