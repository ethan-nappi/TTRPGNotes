## Summary
An orphan tielfling with an eye for ancient knowledge. Nawvel is rarely seen with his eyes in the pages of a book, whether or not they were written by him. He's always had an obsession with looking into ancient knowledge, having been inspired by the legend of [[Te-Guid]], the only tiefling figure he had to look up to. 

Having grown up in [[Vallar Home of Orphans]] with [[Nook]], he felt he was responsible for looking after her, even if she seemed impossible to handle.

## Appearance

Pink skin, scrawny, and tall, Nawvel has ram-like horns that curl below the ear and thinner tail that ends in a simple point. He has pupil-less dark red eyes. Almost always wearing an [[Aspirit Guild]] leather jacket with common [[Vallar]] clothing.

## Mentality

##### PERSONAL HISTORY
Nawvel had been in the [[Vallar Home of Orphans]] for as long as he can remember, never having a true parental or family figure in his life.   
   
At around age 9, he started to take notice in a tiefling girl in the orphanage, [[Nook]], who started to get picked on for being a tiefling and having strange scales on her body. Nawvel stepped in and has stepped up for her in the orphanage knowing the pain from being bullied for being different.   
   
Over time the two got closer, and Nawvel began to study alongside [[Nook]], teaching her things she seemed to be interested in.

##### EDUCATION
Nawvel got into the [[Aspirit Guild]] a year earlier than was allowed, faking his age in his application. He's always excelled in basic schooling and found no issue getting into the guild.

##### INTELLECT
Nawvel is a very quick learner, especially in understanding mathematics and arcane concepts.

##### LANGUAGES
Nawvel can speak Common, Dwarvish, Draconic and Infernal.

## Personality

##### MOTIVATION
Nawvel is a part of the [[Aspirit Guild]], meaning he values truth and knowledge above all else. He wouldn't hesitate on any opportunity to record information that hasn't been written elsewhere.

##### INEPTITUDES
Nawvel is very knowledgeable, so it's hard to present something new to him when it comes to the arcane and history, his favorite subjects to research.

##### FLAWS
It is very easy to make Nawvel anxious. Slight imperfections, changes in routine, or any sense of disorder can set him off.

##### QUIRKS
Nawvel when he's anxious can be seen fidgeting very quickly with objects or twitching his fingers and certain parts of his face.

## Social

##### CONTACTS & RELATIONS
Nawvel is an important member within the [[Aspirit Guild]] of [[Vallar]]. He's climbed up the ladder rather quickly due to his personal pursuits into history. He's already gained the power to arrest individuals in the name of the [[Aspirit Guild]] who holds small amounts of authority in a number of cities.  
   
The only person who's close to Nawvel is [[Nook]] but even then, his level of care appears to be minor. They've been confused to be brother and sister multiple times but they are in no way related.
