# Queen Roseanne Of Kitan

Rosanne Garrison is the current Queen of [[Kitan]] and the daughter of former King [[Elric Garrison]], having great influence over the counsel and her father’s decisions as she is his eldest daughter. While her father ruled, she pushed the decisions that were in the interest of the person and generally focused on the quality of life of the citizens.
  
She spent most of her time about the city as princess with a bodyguard or two. She never misses a parade or event that lies within the city walls. Rumor has it that she also did horseback archery with some of the soldiers but most believe a nice and pretty lady like her wouldn’t do such a thing. She is extremely close with her sister [[Elizabeth Garrison]] and is extremely protective of her, often telling the guards to stay with her rather than herself. Kitan generally viewed Rosanne with high praise and many of the city's women were envious of her looks and lifestyle. It was rumored among some of the higher ups in power and wealth that Elizabeth had interest in the prince of [[Volcandor]], the half-elven [[Rolan Evergold]], however she denied any interest in him.  
  
Growvold 26, 1163, Rosanne was announced Vollow Queen of Kitan. Now the Queen, Rosanne is rarely seen outside the walls of the keep. Many are skeptical of how she'll rule Kitan. A young queen at only the age of 23 and the sudden death of her parents has forced an abrupt change in her lifestyle and personality. Rumors from within the castle say that Rosanne has been acting rather strange since the kidnapping. The castle's inhabitants have a good grasp on keeping her conditions secret, however the rumors that have slipped out detail extreme mental instability.  
  

### Dragon's Breath Cult attack of 1163

Ari 25, 1163, Rosanne was reportedly captured after going out with her sister, Elizabeth, to a festival within Kitan, she was captured by cultists that Elizabeth and her were unable to fend off. Ari 26 posters went out for her rescue, promising to pay a thousand gold pieces per person that was involved in her rescue. Later that day Elizabeth was seen by citizens fleeing the castle in a hurry leading to speculation that she was involved.  
  
In the early morning of Ari 27, 1163, the day of the attack, Rosanne was brought back to Kitan safe and sound by a band of adventurers and by Elizabeth. Only minutes after her rescue was when the attack initiated. The attack lasted over the course of the next five days, although the last day was mainly searching for leftover dragons and taking out what remained of their forces. Elric Garrison and [[Tellina Garrison-Windire]] as well as a number of other members of the royal family were slain. Elizabeth is a notable survivor.  
  
Volcandor still has many of their troops stationed at Kitan while the city rebuilds. Namor Evergold, current King of Volcandor, can be seen at events and meetings with Rosanne. He is currently there assisting her on how to rule a city. The reasons for Rosanne's capture and the attack are still unknown.
