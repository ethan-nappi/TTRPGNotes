# Prince Rolan of Volcandor
Rolan Evergold is the prince of [[Volcandor]]. [^prince] He is the son of [[Xerxes Evergold]] and [[Ina' Yezaa Evergold]] and half-brother to [[Namor Evergold]]. Rolan is known to be an excellent and charismatic fighter, beloved by the citizens of Volcandor. Recently after the passing of his father and former King Xerxes Evergold, Rolan has disappeared, without ever giving word to his family of where he was going. Many theorize that Rolan had something to do with his father's death, but Namor forbids talk of that while an official investigation is underway. [^Runaway]
