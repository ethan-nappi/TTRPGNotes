Known for his iron will and accuracy amongst the tops of [[Silvaya's Elites]], El Fing managed to land a spot as a strategist for his incredible strategies for defending the forest from monsters. El Fing along his Elite Service days found himself on a trip to the [[Faewild]] where he would find a thunderous hand cannon ([[Maxim Machine Gun]]) that can be heard from across the battlefield with every shot. Often he was seen in the battlefield accompanied by his partner [[Ela Fing]] who when together were a formidable and unstoppable duo in battle. Now, his skills make him more useful planning in the war room. 

Blessed bow.
