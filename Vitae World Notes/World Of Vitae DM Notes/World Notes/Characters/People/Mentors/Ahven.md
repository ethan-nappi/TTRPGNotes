## Summary

Ahven is an Aarakocra monk that owns the [[Monastery of Aard]]. His origins are unknown but has made it clear through teaching his students that he means to do good. 

## Appearance

Ahven has the body of a six foot and one inch man but the head, wings, and talons of a white western screech owl. It's important to note he has two arms separate from his wings which span out to 10 feet from end to end. Along with his owl head, he maintains the beak, head swivel, and fixated eyes that an owl has. Ahven's feathers are a pure white color that cover almost every inch of his body leaving only his talons, eyes, and beak exposed. 

## Relevance

Ahven owns the monastery that Velrys, [[Rolan Evergold]], [[El Fing]], and El's children, [[Aeri Fing]] and [[Aero Fing]] went to. Although the Fing family were the only ones to have had direct contact with him, all who attended the monastery were sure to have seen him in passing.
