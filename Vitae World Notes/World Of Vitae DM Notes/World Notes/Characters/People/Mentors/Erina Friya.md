# "The Caretaker"
Erina Frigalin was the primary caretaker of girls at [[Vallar Home of Orphans]]. It was Erina's job to make sure all girls had their health and education needs addressed. Grants, donations, access to care, and orphanage population often determined how in control Erina was of how much care she was able to provide. 

## Personal History
Caretaking was a lifestyle for Erina. She often took it upon herself to fill the needs of the orphanage, often at her own expense. Having been raised in Vallar without systems like the orphanage, she understands the needs of the children that were like her and did everything to give them the best lives possible. This kind of care was essential to [[Nook]] who had been at the orphanage since she was only months old.
