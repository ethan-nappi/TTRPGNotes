# Princess Elizabeth of Kitan
## Summary

Elizabeth Garrison is the younger of the two Garrison sisters of [[Kitan]]. Less involved with politics and more involved in the social scene, Elizabeth is the best singer and one of the best dancers in the city playing her music at every major festival and mingling at every smaller event she can. The one flaw with Elizabeth is that she has some rebellious tendencies. It’s not uncommon to see her stay out late nights in the town wooing people at social events. Unlike [[Roseanne Garrison]], it’s known that Elizabeth is great with weaponry as been reported to have twice been attacked by gangs within the town with her sister and the fights were over with the gang members on the ground before any guards showed up. The gang members were never killed but left seriously injured, further adding to the validity of her weapon experience.  
  
Elizabeth due to her rebellious nature, often is criticized by her family, excluding Rosanne. The citizens of Kitan aren't as fond of her as they are of Elizabeth, although she does have her admirers, especially among the men of the city. It's important to note that Elizabeth never does anything more than to woo both men and women at social gatherings although many believe she's much more promiscuous. Elizabeth has also been known to have a hot temper, leading to the crude nickname of "Elizabitch."  
  

## Personal History
### Dragon's Breath Cult attack of 1163

[[Volcandor]] still has many of their troops stationed at Kitan while the city rebuilds. [[Namor Evergold]], current King of Volcandor, can be seen at events and meetings with Rosanne. Elizabeth has been noted to give dirty looks to Namor and is never seen apart from Rosanne.
