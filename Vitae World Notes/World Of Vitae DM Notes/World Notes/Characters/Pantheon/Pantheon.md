[[Crea]] - Goddess of Creation
Crea is the first deity of all the deities in the pantheon. Crea is responsible for all creation and is the mother of the rest of the deities. As the old tale goes, Crea when creating the universe succumbed to the pressure of having to think of everything at once and died. Due to the way the tale goes, there are many who question if Crea had ever existed, there is no way to prove that she did. See [[Birthing of Our Deities]].

Current Deities
[[Maturl]] - God of The Elements
Maturl is the master over the elements, often presented as fire, water, air and earth. Maturl is believed to be the one who constructed the elemental planes that would end up colliding to make up the material plane. He is directly responsible for the heat of the sun, and providing water, wind, and earth for the deities to use to create life. To create more complex materials like metal he will often enlist the help of other deities as he did in the [[Tale of Gold]] where he called upon Lux to help make gold.

[[Beurteilung]] - God of Judgement
Beurteilung is the god that decides what is good or evil and determines the punishment or reward that should come of any action. It is believed that even something as simple as walking can be perceived as good provided that you are following the laws of physics and that your destination is right. Beurteilung is responsible in making sure the deities are having their fair share of the world and that fairness is maintained.

[[Lux]] - Goddess of Light
Lux is the favored deity of humans and is worshiped by most clerics and paladins. She is responsible for all light whether natural or magical. In another sense, she is also responsible for clarity and "lighting the way" for the world. She is often depicted having arguments with Nox as Nox is her opposing deity. In most stories, Lux wins against Nox and only loses on her own accord. Despite all of the deities being born at the same time, Lux is also depicted as the older sister of Nox.

[[Nox]] - Goddess of Darkness
Nox is responsible for the moon, shadows, and mystery. She is the least favored of the deities, often being associated with evil. Many see her magic as being meant for confusion, control, or obstructing the world in a harmful way. In most kingdoms her exclusive worship is illegal but can be worshiped alongside Lux. Nox is depicted as the younger sister of Lux in most literature and often is shown being pushed down by the other deities to keep her from wreaking havoc on Vitae.

In historical texts, priests have been documented to push the idea that worshiping Nox believing that her destructive tendencies originate from becoming envious of Lux's praise. However, those same priests after their deaths were found to have been practicing witchcraft.

[[Sturm]] - God of Tempest
Sturm is responsible for storms, wind, and controlling the flow of water (requiring assistance from Maturl and Nox). Sturm is often worshiped by farmers for plentiful rain and by fishermen for calm seas.

[[Airda]] - Goddess of Nature
Airda is the favored deity of druids and is responsible for the handling of vegetation, nurturing, and growth.


[[Aries]] - God of Fury
Aries is most commonly favored by dwarves and barbarians. Aries is seen as being responsible for anger, strong emotions, and sometimes passion. Although capable of inducing rage on his own, requires the assistance of Fredte for determination and Nox for emotions that combine sadness.


[[Fredte]] - God of Peace
Fredte is worshiped by Silvaya and is responsible for diplomacy and calm emotions.


[[Deair]] - God of Beasts
Deair is often worshiped by hunters, farmers, and rangers and is responsible for all non-sentient creatures. Praying and performing rituals for Deair are believed to provide different results for each group. For hunters, they believe Deair will grant them a bountiful hunt. For farmers, they believe they will receive protection from beasts wanting to eat their crop, their livestock, or them. For rangers, they believe they will be granted protection for both themselves and the forests they protect as well as a chance to receive their own companion.


[[Toitsu]] - Goddess of Unity
Toitsu is responsible for teamwork and binding creatures together. Toitsu is believed to be the reason for why civilization and the feeling of love exists.


[[Pulan]] - God of Knowledge
Pulan is responsible for any information that can be learned such as history, science, mathematics and magic (although is not responsible for magic itself). Pulan is most often worshiped by scholars and wizards although really gained popularity after [[Te-Guid]] revealed his deep worship for Pulan.


[[Truco]] - God of Trickery
*"Truco is the the most honest deity to have ever existed. Tells nothing but the truth, is responsible for all truth ever." - [[Te-Guid]]*
Truco is responsible for illusions, secrets, and deceit.


[[Vada]] - Goddess of Life
Vada is responsible for the health of all living things.


[[Almes]] - God of Death
Almes is responsible for what happens to all life after death. Death alongside Vada will choose whether something lives or dies and what happens to the being afterwards whether they only lose a limb or become a ghost. The considerations the two make when making these decisions is best seen in the "[[The Dove, The Raven, The Cat]]" tale.
