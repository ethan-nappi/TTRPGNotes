## Summary
The Dragon's Breath Cult is the biggest, most secretive cult on the continent of [[Vida Yang]]. The organization's end goal is unknown, as well as what drives the cult to grow. Their number of followers appears to nearly reach a thousand but that number could be much higher. Hinted at by it's name, it appears that it associates itself with dragons and is believed to have a malicious intent. There are numerous theories on what their plans might be but nothing is certain. The main party know very little of the cult but know they were the ones to summon the Purple Dragon use the dragon for unknown reasons. In order to do this they need a [[Dragon Tamer]] of the purple dragon's type. One person has such a power, , who is being hunted by the cult. However, she is currently being protected by the party and the [[Silvaya]]n Military. The cult was first heard of in [[Vallar]] in the year 1134 ADP after a number of cultists were seen drawing symbols all over the city and delivering unauthorized magical goods from the [[Faewild]] into the city.
