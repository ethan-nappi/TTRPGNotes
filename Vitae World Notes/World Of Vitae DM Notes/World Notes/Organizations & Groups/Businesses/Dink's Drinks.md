Dink's Drinks is the family's winery within the city of [[Uniton Republa]]. It was founded 1103 ADP by [[Dink Dink I]] at the age of 32. It was started during part of a major class divide in Uniton in which Dink Dink I made a business that quickly shot them into the wealthier end of Uniton.  Dink's Drinks has become so popular and wealthy within Uniton that members of the family (such as Peema Dink-Wimeem and Yeev Dink) have seats within the politics of Uniton.
