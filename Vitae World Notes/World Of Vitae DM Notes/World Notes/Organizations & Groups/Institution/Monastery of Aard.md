> _"This might be personal bias but I love the place. You get rewarded for being good at beating people up, not beating people up, getting beat up, and not getting beat up. Plus you're isolated with like-minded folks with a nice view of a beautiful forest and gorgeous ocean. The teachers are just wonderful too. I would know, I own the place." - [[Ahven]]
