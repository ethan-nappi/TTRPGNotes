> _"An Aspiriter came up to me once asking about how I managed to obtain my glorious appearance writing down every detail without taking her eyes off me. I wonder if she published my lie of rubbing gelatinous slime on me to get soft skin or eating it to increase cup size... pretty insulting when she asked why I ate so little." - [[Elizabeth Garrison]]

The Aspirit Guild operates primarily from the [[Aspirit Guild Center]] in [[Int'Alla]]. The Aspirit Guild [[Vallar Liverlin Library]] in [[Vallar]].
## Structure
Their structure can be simplified into three parts. The High Seers at the top, Mystics in the middle, and Wonderkin at the bottom of the rankings, each dividing into groups that define their areas of specialty. 

**High seers** are the highest ranking members in the Aspirit Guild. They're responsible for ultimately deciding what information gets published, where investigators and resources are put, and who gets an assignment. 

**Mystics** are experienced members who have proven to have potential to remain largely independent and can provide guidance when put into groups. They often are told to investigate higher stake assignments where information correctness is vital and the investigation must be done efficiently. Alternatively, they can be seen gathering the collective information from Wonderkin groups, organizing where they should go next and filtering out useless information. Mystics have access to more locations than Wonderkin in that they're allowed into most private libraries, laboratories, and research areas. 

**Wonderkin** are among the lowest in the rankings, they're often the ones out asking lesser important individuals questions and doing investigations almost exclusively in spaces available to the public. To become a wonderkin you must have a recommendation from a library in the area of the Aspirit center and have an interview conducted to make sure you are genuinely interested in the pursuit of discovery. All new members of the Aspirit Guild are wonderkin. 

**Aspirit Guild Groups** are separated based on their areas of expertise and consist of mystics and wonderkin but not high seers. Whether they focus on archaeology, translation, magic, or some other area, they will have their own name (typically in common). Here are some well-known groups:

-   Beaut - Investigators that gather information to improve general health.
-   Clam - Individuals who handle exploration off the mainland or in the water.
-   Crier - Aspiriters meant to report back on recent news events and also spreads news from other settlements.
-   Fern - Studies the changes in nature and tracks monster populations.
-   Parchment - Researchers responsible for uncovering old texts.
-   Quill - Responsible for writing the information that aspiriters find for publishing and for translating important text.
-   Rox - Aspiriters with an expertise in exploration through runes or caves.
-   Sensor - Responsible for tracking the moods and needs of citizens.
-   Worth - Records the trends in market pricing.

### Public Agenda

> _"I've always appreciated the work of the Aspirit Guild but every one of them has some strange quirk about them. One young Wonderkin insisted on obtaining the details of the exact portions of meat to fruit I had on my plate before I took my son to a dragon watch point and the instant I gave those details he spun 'round and briskly walked away. Odd ones they are." - [[Lamont Evergold]]
