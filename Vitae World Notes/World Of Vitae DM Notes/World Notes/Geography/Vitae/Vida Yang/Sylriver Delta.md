### Silveryn

### Lindvaron

The island just below is "[[Lindvaron]]." It was named after the blue Lindwyrm "[[Agwaar]]" that was discovered to have lived there. It died of an unknown cause sometime after the Dragon Peace.  

### Daveol

The Island nearest to [[Daleton]] is known as "[[Daveol]]." A play on the words Dave and Devil.  

### Rettera

The southeastern most island is known as "[[Rettera]]."  

### Deviltooth

The island in which [[ShardensVale]] sits on is known as "[[Deviltooth]]." It is the largest of all five islands. It was named as such when tieflings were discovered to inhabit the area, one of the first times a settlement of tieflings had been discovered.  
The formation of the five islands we're believed to once all be connected, old historical maps compared to new ones say that the islands shift anywhere between 1/8 to 1/2 of a mile every few years. There are conspiracies that believe the islands used to form a star, possibly connected by a necrotic force, once creating a portal to the underworld. However, it is no longer an accepted theory among most historians as tieflings report coming from a colder more barren land in the south.
