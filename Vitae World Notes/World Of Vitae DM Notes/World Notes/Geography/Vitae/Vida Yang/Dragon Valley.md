### Geography

Dragon Valley is defined as the grassland between the mountain ranges that lie to the north and south of the valley, [[Snow Still Mountain Range]] and Northern [[Maturielle Mountains]] respectively. It's covered in tall grasses and bushes with only but a few large and tall willow trees scattered about. Throughout the valley the lands appear to be broken up with many small cliffs and constant inclines and declines in elevation. About only a quarter mile out from the Riftide River is there a cliffside ranging from 300 to 500 feet depending where you're standing from. That cliff side marks the end of what's considered the valley.

### History

The valley gets its name from where all dragons retreated to after losing territory to most of Vida, prior it was known as Drake Valley. The valley would come to be the location that dragons would end up making peace with humans, promising never to cause trouble with civilization again.
