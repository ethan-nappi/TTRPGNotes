> "Oh the place is beautiful. Everything looks like its dancing and it all just flows so beautifully together. The perfect place for a vacation home, especially since a week long vacation would last well past a month!"  - [[Te-Guid]] Firae

  
  

The Faewild on the planar map is due east of the material plane and is home to all sylvan and fae life. Dragons have never had rule over this location as it is an example of what it is like when the control is at the hands of other creatures while the world was still being structured.

  

Travel East of [[Vida Yang]] past the [[Riftide River‌]], through the [[World's End Fog]]‌ and you'll have reached the Faewild. Only few have ever ventured here, one of the most notable explorers being [[Te-Guid]]. His research is the reason for why we know what we do about the Faewild as only before could we find out clues through the creatures that came from beyond the [[World's End Fog]]‌. He discovered that the bridge between the two dimensions is very slim and requires certain components to cross over into but nothing is required to come into the Material Plane.

  

### Crossing Ritual

To cross over into the Faewild you must have:

-   A depressurized glass jar with a thin metal cap (any solid cap works)
-   The head of an [[Undershroom]]
-   A live butterfly

The process is relatively simple but must be done quickly. The first step is to go as far as possible into the [[World's End Fog]], adventurers should know they're far enough when they can no longer see their toes. Then, adventurers must poke a hole into the cap and mutter "Talkanae Youp", informal Sylvan for "take me away." The adventurers will find themselves alone with the butterfly in a black void in which they must eat the [[Undershroom]] head quickly or be sent back. Upon eating the head, the butterfly will appear to grow in size and once it grows to be ten feet tall the adventurer will be shoved by powerful winds into a fog that looks to be the equivalent of the [[World's End Fog]]. By the end of this you will know that you've made it to the other side.

To go back one must simply turn around approximately in the same place they came from and continue walking. The transition will be seamless between the Faewild and the Material Plane. It should be noted that the butterfly stays behind in this process and will not work if it has even a slim bite from the [[Undershroom]].
