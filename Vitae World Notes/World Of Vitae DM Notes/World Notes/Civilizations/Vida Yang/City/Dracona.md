Dracona, the city that made history by being the spearhead of the peace talks between humanoids and dragons. The city is made up of primarily dragonborn and is the place of origin for the dragonborn race. The city gets its name from the dragons that inhabited the area before [[First Freedom Fighters]] took the territory over in the effort to push away the dragons. This effort is known as _[[The Final Gate]]_.

### History

### The Conquering

When tensions rose and conflicts become more violent between humanoids and dragons, the Humankind decided to put together a plan to slowly push dragons out of Vida. As part of the plan, Humankind wanted to take over the [[Nor Maturi Mont]] in hopes dragons would be pushed northward. As part of The Final Millennium, a location of revered dragons, who held many humanoids captive and performed numerous horrible experiments on, would soon leave after the attacks. This location would soon become the foundation to [[Dracona]].
