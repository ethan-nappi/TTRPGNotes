Vallar is an elven city that is among the oldest cities of [[Vida Yang]]. It lies in the area between the [[Evere Titanem mountain range]] and the [[Thickette Peaks]], otherwise known as the [[Fae's Gate Valley]]. They were a large part in establishing the peace talks between the dragons to end the [[Dragon Rule Era]]. 

Vallar is currently under rule of [[Myla Liverlin]].

Vallar is responsible for the first direct attack on the Dragon's Breath Cult, hanging five of their members in the city's square. See [[Dragon Witch Trials Of Vallar]].


### **History**

#### Early History

Vallar was established in Circa 11500 DR long before the dragon peace. Its exact date of establishment is unknown as an accepted way to track time was yet to be created.  
  

#### The Origin of Wild Sorcery

It was believed when founding the city that magic had flowed in from the Faewild over into the Alma Yang through that valley and if they stayed there for long enough, citizens would begin to be born with the ability to control magic, following the logic that magical creatures flowed in from beyond the fog, so would magic. To some extent this turned out to be true as over the course of some time citizens had the capabilities of a sorcerer but found themselves struggling to control their magic. These sorcerers would then be deemed wild sorcerers and Vallar would be the place of origin for all wild sorcery. It is still uncertain how one happens to become born with these capabilities but all experiments so far have been proven unsuccessful.
