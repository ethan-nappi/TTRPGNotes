(common: The Resilience of Vitae)

Everestor is the Dwarven city that lies south of the [[Dragon Valley]] on the [[Viskye Mountain]]. The city exists as one of the two bastions for the dragon valley. It was the largest prison for dragons to keep people and monsters. For those that were imprioned for eternity and for future generations, slowly their physiology changed to become dwarves.
