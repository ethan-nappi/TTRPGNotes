Volcandor is the oldest human kingdom and the third oldest kingdom of Vida Yang. The kingdom gets it's name from the nearby volcano [[Mount Defi]], that the city used to forge weapons and fertilize soil.

### History

Volcandor began around 9000 DR, where humans and dwarves settled down beside a mountain to hide from giants that ruled the northern parts of [[Vida Yang]]. Volcandor was among the five civilizations to create and then further enforce the [[Peace Treaty of Vitae for Dragons and All]].
