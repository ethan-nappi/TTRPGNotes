#Kitan 
Kitan, a city of the new world that has mantained integrity and an iron will throughout it's lifespan. Nearly 1000 years old, it stands as a place of inspiration for humans. Once the resting place for woodland giants, humans decided to siege the land and to forge a city in which will leave a mark to the giants that tried to take over the lands after dragons let go of their rule over Alma Yang. The Garrison family name stands as a token to the everlasting life of Kitan, lasting ever since the land was claimed by humans starting with King [[Vairson Garrison]]. It has survived numerous attacks over the years whether it be due to conquest or revenge. Although sometimes succumbing to the attack, Kitan will always resurrect to the way it was before.
