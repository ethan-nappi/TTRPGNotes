Silvaya is the oldest elven city on [[Vida Yang]] in the center of the [[Silvayan Forest]] (formerly Darklefen). Silvaya gets it's name from the forest's rich silver deposits and its history of silver weapon creation. These silvered weapons were important to deal with a lot of the devils that tried to dominate the land before natural humanoids did. Silvaya is best known for it's incredible defenses, being a safe haven in the dangerous Silvayan Forest. The exterior of the kingdom is made up of nonflammable Redwood trees that are anywhere between 220ft to 300ft tall. On the interior, similarly size trees are spread through out that have much thicker bark than exterior trees. Most structures are carved into these trees that are used for a variety of living, religious, and other services. The only structures that don't use carved out trees are for the military.
