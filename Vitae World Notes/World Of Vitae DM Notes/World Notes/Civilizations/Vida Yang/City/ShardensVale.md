## History

On the largest island in the [[Sylriver delta]], ShardensVale has left it's mark as the most beautiful city in [[Vitae]], taking the title from Silvaya in 699 ADP. ShardenVale prides itself on its knowledge, diversity, and artistry. Over the course of time ShardenVale has become a wealth of knowledge with many of its scholars, monks, mages, and so many others being born into a place that encourages the advancement in all aspects of science, magic, exploration, and life. It's a land of the free.  
A brave place to place a city isolated from the main world. ShardenVale places itself near the center of the largest isle in the collection of isles not too far from the western edge of  [[Vida Yang]] also known as “[[Shattered Waters]].” Difficult to navigate the waters around the isles without a properly trained crew and a boat sturdy enough to handle the turbulent waves and sharp rocks which can be the doom for ill prepared travelers. It also is marked down, as of writing this, to be the closest city to [[Alma Yin]]. Even still it is no short travel over to Alma Yin. However they were the first city to reach the shores of Alma Yin, venturing to an area once forbidden by the dragons of the water. The seas in which ShardenVale is surrounded by is rich in mysterious waterborne life and materials not found anywhere else around the shores, rivers or lakes of Vida Yang.
