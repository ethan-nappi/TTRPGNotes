### Culture

Uniton is all about being on the move and striving to follow the "golden dream" of being on top and finding a seat in the government. You're looked down upon if you spend your days indoors too much or if you're not working toward some vision. To the citizens, every day is about coming closer to that dream, even if it hurts them. Recognizing that their roads may be painful, there is a big emphasis on hosting big festivals and donating to temples or churches to keep the spirits up of Uniton's citizens.
