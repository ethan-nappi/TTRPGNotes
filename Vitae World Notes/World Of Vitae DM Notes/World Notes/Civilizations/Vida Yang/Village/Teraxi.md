Teraxi, a town constructed from the elves who wanted to break from some of the typical traditions of [[Silvaya]] but couldn't escape Silvaya's rule over its forest. It's currently made up of a number of non-elven races who want to assimilate themselves with a more elven way of living without sticking to the stricter traditions of Silvaya. The town was built around a rare black cherry-willow tree, the largest of its kind in the [[Silvayan Forest]], named "Tae Aista Hanir" (Elven for "The Blessed Willow"), which yearly it drops cherries that have natural healing properties. Many of the towns traditions include Silvayan traditions that include Tae Aista Hanir in some fashion.
