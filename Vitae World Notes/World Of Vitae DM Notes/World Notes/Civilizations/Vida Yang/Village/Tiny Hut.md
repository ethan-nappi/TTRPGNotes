### History

In 1146 ADP, the [[Tiny Huntsmen]], a small scholarly party comprised of gnomes and halflings with the most notable member [[Lilly Bloomin]], they ventured to Uniton to send their research in for evaluation at the [[Uniton Academy of Wizardry]] (UAW). After great praise over their findings by the UAW officials, the Tiny Huntsmen were made an offer to continue their research with some investments from the UAW. Of course the Tiny Huntsmen accepted the offer. Lilly having been the most well versed in the land of Bamguard Forest, she took the lead in helming this new discovery effort they were making.  In 1146, Tiny Hut was established as the location where they'd be doing their research, despite their wizard having learned a bigger and better spell to house them than the Tiny Hut. Initially their goal was to find out more about Bamguard Forest, but as the years went on, they wanted to focus on magical experimentation, especially since they were away from any control of law that wasn't their own. Due to this change, in 1148 ADP, the UAW dropped their investments into Tiny Hut. It was transformed into a recognized settlement after the group started to grow into the hundreds, their investment from the UAW was dropped, and Lilly wanted to look for trade and protection between kingdoms as they were left vulnerable. 

### Rumors of Witchcraft

[[Kitan]] had been giving them protection from 1150ADP - 1153 ADP in exchange for magical goods and sharing research. Kitan wanted to further progress their understanding of magic as it was something all kingdoms, especially human ones, were lacking. One day, [[Elric Garrison]] of Kitan publicly denounced Tiny Hut after claiming it had been using them for protecting their dark practices. Soldiers that were posted there were pulled out of Tiny Hut immediately. News of the denouncement went out to the other kingdoms and quickly left Tiny Hut without support or trade flowing from anyone other than through wandering merchants and curious mages.
