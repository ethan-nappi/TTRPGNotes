Nessel is a small village on the southern end of Vida Yang. The village remains mostly to itself, separated by natural geography from the rest of the continent. Within the town there is little to do however, they keep information about the island south of them under lock and key for unknown reason and are currently the easiest settlement to set out from to investigate the island. Villagers are generally quiet and humbly keep to themselves but they still heavily value community.
