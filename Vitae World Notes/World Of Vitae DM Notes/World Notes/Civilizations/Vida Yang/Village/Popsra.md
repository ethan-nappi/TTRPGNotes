> _"It's grueling being the mayor of such a dark place, but we were born to be the first bastion against The Shallow Darkness, and many of us die that way." - Mayor [[Evohn Henderison_]]

 Popsra is a large village built on the northern end of the [[Ropswamp]], also known as The Shallows or Shallow Darkness. The village is often seen as the truest test of strength and will within the continent of [[Vida Yang]], as the village is constantly under threat of the creatures that lurk in the Shallows. Within the village, it is expected that you are prepared to protect the village from an attack or prepared to be called out to venture into the swamp to eliminate threats if the need arises. Popsra gets its name from a mashup of "pop" and the orcish word for "swamp."
