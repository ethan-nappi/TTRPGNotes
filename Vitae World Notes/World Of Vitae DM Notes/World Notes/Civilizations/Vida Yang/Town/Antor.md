Antor is the small human town created by fisherman, huntsmen, and herbalists of  [[Volcandor]]  that didn't want to be taxed as hard as they were for the work that they were doing. Slowly years after the dragon peace, Antor grew as a primarily fishing town. Antor notably isn't aided by Volcandor in any way other than through trade.

Antor is the hometown and current resting place of [[Amelya Senti]], a unique and potentially useful warrior in Antor.

### History

After the raising of taxes on poorer citizens in [[Volcandor]], some individuals who were hit the hardest left the city to go form a new settlement free of Volcandor's rule. Guilds of huntsmen, herbalists, and fishermen had disbanded after the cost of leaving and reentering the city with their goods proved to be too expensive on top of the tax cost and made way for a promising spot on the edge of the Sylvayan forest.  
  
The first years of the town's founding were brutal as forest wildlife proved to be rather difficult to deal with and the reliance on fishing as a primary source of food left a lot to be desired in the advancement of boating and fishing technology. Many members left early in Antor's development, heading back to Volcandor or making the trek to Kitan as the next best option. Despite these challenges, Antor persevered and has grown into the state it is in today.
