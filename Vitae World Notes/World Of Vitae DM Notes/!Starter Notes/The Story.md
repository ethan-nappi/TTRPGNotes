In Ari, the [[Dragon's Breath Cult]] saw an opportunity to seize Kitan 

In Jade 1163 ADP, Nook was reunited with the book and The cult began to hunt her. After some weeks, she learned Namor was behind some of the plot and had taken the dragon for himself. After a fight, she took the dragon a flew away. She was rescued from the wilds by Kitan but was kept locked away in a tower until it was safe for her but was accompanied and entertained to keep a sense of normalcy. She happily spent time in that tower, understanding the necessity but did express discomfort after some time and lived free to roam in the castle. The cult was believed to have been defeated or at least bested. 

In Jade 1165 ADP, a festival was held celebrating the Queen's reign. Nook attended for the first time in public wearing Namor's crown and the purple dragon disguised with her as a purple cat. During Namor's toast to the Queen, he made mention of Nook and her magical prowess, looking to instigate a fight. Nook taunted him with his old crown, stoking an evil glare from him. During the tail end of the festival, an assassin was sent after the dragon. The book's awareness alerted Nook and a legendary bolt of magic missed the dragon hitting Nook. The book's recovery spell sapped the life away from the dragon and a number of others around her. Volcandor guards chased her thinking his was her doing and she ran off. She is still being hunted.

[[Nook]] ran to [[Lady Sadine]] for help after some time. Knowing she couldn't turn to any royalty she went to the last place everyone expected her. Nook wanted her help as well, as she's been haunted by Nightmares caused by [[Noxmares]] that feast off the bad memory. However, [[Lady Sadine]] told her she simply had to grieve and that she could always return but not to stay.
