## Long Arc 1: Little Band of Heroes
Purpose: Each PC finds a new home with each other

### What's going on?

The Devil's Little Witch is being hunted. The adventurers, sought her out for various reasons but they're close to finding her. She's wanted by almost everyone, but Kitan, Volcandor (disguised as Antor), The Cult (disguised as Uniton), and an Elven General have particular interest.

Kitan wants the book back, knowing fully well what it's capable of in the wrong hands but Nook can't part with it if they tried. So they're trying to get her to trust them again after failing to protect her and the dragon at the festival.
