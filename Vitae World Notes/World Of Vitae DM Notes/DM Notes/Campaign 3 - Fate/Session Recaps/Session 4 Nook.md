Kei and Ailouros ran towards the scream while Casey and Amadeus remained to protect the princess. Goobus stayed back as well but left when he heard her scream for help. Amadeus, shoving his sending stone into casey's gun, had it blasted at goobus, who took it and ran. Kei and Ailouros beat the crowd to a confusing scene where 4 people lay unconscious, 1 dead, and a woman in distress. Kei assured her everything would be fine and after some investigation, it was discovered the witch probably caused this and ran north, Ailouros picked up a scythe and goobus made a paladin uncomfortable. Amadeus showed a stableman chiropractic techniques while Casey setup the horses. Meeting up and encountering Elizabeth, Elizabeth distracted the mob before they discovered the witch went north. The players began trailing her.

You discovered the horses names are:
- Lotze
- 5'4
- Criminal

You took three steps to narrowing your search on the witch:
- Kei vibe checked animals and they were sus of a creature that went north
- Casey made binoculars that gave vision of where someone walked previously
- Amadeus detected residual dark magic on the surfaces of things along the way

Spending the night to finish your walk to the witch, Ailouros spots the witch's campfire, but so do Ailouros' voices who physically push her towards the witch. At the same time, Goobus encounters an awakened shrub that wants goobs to attack his friends with him. Only Goobs understands him. He's left there while everyone rushs to help Ailouros and the witch stands up, ready to fight.
