THE RECAP OF SESSION 2
We kicked off with a fiery shot from [[Lady Sadine]] blasting through Goobus. His inventory flying everywhere it appeared he was killed in one shot. Kei quickly ran to calm the witch down while Amadeus guarded Casey, who sucked up the attack the witch had built up. Ailouros waited for the right moment to strike and caught the moment Goobus went inside to free the wisp in a lantern. Quickly, the witch's defenses broke down and began weeping. The party discovers from her that the devil's little witch sought her out to remove nightmares, but Lady Sadine refused. The little witch was assassinated but a powerful item she keeps kept her alive at the cost of something she held dear. It was also revealed she had a black cat with her, one who's description peaked the interest of Ailouros. Once Sadine was back to normal, she requested the party keeps the witch safe. Kei shook on it, a magically bind that he should keep or face consequences. Walking back, the party seeked information and supplies, and reconvened at a gathering in the camp where sponsors were looking for adventurers that had information on the witch. Casey and goobus found particular interest in the Princess Of Kitan, Elizabeth Garrison. After a convincing showing of the ball lightning and stating the witch sought out sadine and is now headed to the Sylriver, she agreed to sponsor your efforts, so long as you brought her back to Kitan unharmed. Elizabeth claims the witch has a powerful magical item that can't leave her side that belongs to Kitan, oh and a hefty reward will be paid upon her arrival. Once everything was agreed upon, a scream cries out from inside the town.

#### Session 3: The Hunt Continues 

Purpose: Discover the Little Witch's next move

A scream is heard from the middle of the town, a woman came across a dead body, bloody scythe, and strange black markings on the ground. She's middle aged, hands that have worked hard, a farmer. She'll describe she was simply passing through and that she saw a little girl running away from this hours before but thought nothing of it until now. Elizabeth will distract the crowd.

Took 3 horses
- Lotze
- 5'4
- Criminal

The players will need to make three successes to find the witch. On the first night in the forest. An awakened shrub will walk up to goobus and suggest to attack the party. A remnant of the Airdic war. It's confused goobus for a soldier. It is player choice on what to do with him. The shrub carries information about the witch, and a Stunt: Rooting Attacks, cannot move to another zone after being hit.

- Kei vibe checked animals and they were sus of a creature that went north
- Casey made binoculars that gave vision of where someone walked previously
- Amadeus detected residual dark magic on the surfaces of things along the way

Goobs stole the binoculars.
