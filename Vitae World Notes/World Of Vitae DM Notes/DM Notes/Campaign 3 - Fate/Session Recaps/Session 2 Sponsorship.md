THE RECAP

You all came to Popsra, a dark dreary town to join in on the hunt to find The Devil's Little Witch. For whichever reason you chose to do this, you didn't want to do this alone. Quickly you all found each other, not knowing much more than each others names and what you're all capable of. Setting out into the murky swamp, you quickly encountered rolling sheep. Defending yourselves, they all rolled off towards Popsra, and you continued on. Underneath a tree you found an abandoned camping spot, but the camper is long gone. A trio of will o wisps, Will, Bill, and William, barrage you with questions. Once satisfied, they ultimately pointed you to [[Lady Sadine]]'s hut. As Goobus scanned through the window of the witch's hut, spotting only random magical supplies, a caged will o' wisp and a fire bolt hurling straight at goobus.
