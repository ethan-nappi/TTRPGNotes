Recap session 6 - the phoenix queen

You arrive in Kitan. Meeting Elizabeth at the gates, she was excited to see you and promised security was tightened since Nook's absence. You got a good glimpse at Kitan, a city that's strong in spirit, having picked itself time and time again from hard times. Elizabeth joyously played through the streets of the city, drawing quite the crowd. there's a brief exchange between the party and an aspiring adventurer, Pearl, looking to prove herself. She bought a cheap necklace from a magic vendor that Casey went to look into further.

Once in the castle, the Queen herself greeted the party and after thanks, invited them to a royal meal. After properly getting to know one another and what it took to get Nook back, the Queen had a request of the party. She wants to know what King Namor of Volcandor is up to. He'd been staying in Kitan for a long time and a lot of his guard roams the castle, something must be up. Of course, the party could turn up with nothing and she will have to accept that but all of this must be discrete. The party swiftly agreed and King Namor walked in ungraciously, devouring what he could. 

You were free to spend the rest of the afternoon however you saw fit. Kei researched about the relations between dragons and humans and the long war between them. Right after, he invited Nook to join in on an open festival game of hide and seek where they won a pair of sending stones.

Amadeus spent some time with Pearl, having her play a few festival games to hone in her adventuring skills. She failed at whack a mole but rang the bell in a strong man game and got a pocket maul out of it. Ailouros also had Amadeus try the strong man game and he too won *something.*

Pearl showed up again to see the mystic Ailouros and have a secret about her told. Ailouros discovered she's looking to clean up her family name after her father screwed it over for them. Pearl surprised by Ailouros', gave her one of the whirlwind stones from the necklace.

Casey took some time to upgrade their current equipment. Afterwards, Casey found a place to take Elizabeth for first of its kind makeshift cart race. Impressively, Elizabeth pulled through in first and you took some time upgrading each others sending stones.

Goobus spent all of his time searching for a secret room in the library. Unfortunately, the room was never discovered.
