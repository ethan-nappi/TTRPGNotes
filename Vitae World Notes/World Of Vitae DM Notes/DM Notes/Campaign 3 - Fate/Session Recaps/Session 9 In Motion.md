We opened with a scene where a mysterious woman in black robes gets confronted by Themodius. She reveals she has Nutcracker to him and attempts to grab him. Meanwhile, the players fought Kitan's Finest. In a back and forth fight, with a clever use of distractions and provoking fights, 5 Foot Fource came out on top. After quick celebration, Themodius returns to the party alerting Ailouros that someone has her cat and that something more may be being put into motion. After alerting Nook and Queen Roseanne, she decided it was best to return to safety and find Elizabeth who just went out to grab snacks at the same time Namor left. After some searching, Ailouros, Casey, and Kei, walk up on Elizabeth and Namor talking, Namor being handed a scroll of some kind. Namor states he's going to take the magic book and Nook, he won't have it any other way. Then they both spot the three listening in.
