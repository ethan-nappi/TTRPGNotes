## Copy and Paste info

The Devil’s Little Witch's next location is [[Popsra]]. Your group has been tracking her whereabouts, everyone has actually. The continent has been raging trying to locate her. An absurd bounty is on the line afterall. Though for some it wouldn’t be about the gold, it will be about justice. For in the fatal attack on the [[Vida Fae Festival]] in Halfway, she killed or at least harmed those you cared about. To few, it’s sheer adventure you’re looking for. To the least, understanding her evil intent.

You start by finding yourselves, waking up in your camp on the summer solstice. You must head with your party to find the witch…

# Session

Here is a recap of the sessions played so far.

## Dream session with Dungos

A dream comes to those of the original party. You are spectators... watching a scene unfold in front of you. Here is what the people of this scene know…

## Lady session

Group 1
Your group got up early, relatively. The sun will soon set, fog and clouds have rolled in. First day of the summer season means you’ll have a bit of extra daylight past your dinners. You’re finishing your dinners moments before heading out into the [[Ropswamp]], a treacherous place filled with undead and monstrosities. You’re looking for [[Lady Sadine]], a powerful witch that the Little Devil is looking for. She lives in a peculiar looking hut that’s hard to find but you’ll know it once you get there. If you’re quick enough you can catch her on the way there. You have a map of where to go but not what to look out for…


## Witch session

Group 2
Out into Popsra, your informant, [[Ricardo Freem]], is going to inform you of the whereabouts of the witch when the right moment comes. For now, you wait…


## Fate session

Fate Players
It's the year 1165 ADP, days before summer's end. You're arriving into Popsra, looking for other folks who want to hunt the witch. You figured it'd be foolish not to look for people to accompany you on this potentially dangerous quest, not that you think you'll like anyone here. Stumbling through the murky streets, you catch word that a number of folks are setting up a campsite in town just for the bounty hunters. Veterans share wisdom to newcomers as bards play close by to where hunters are eating, sharing stories with adventurers. Now you find yourself amongst them, not really any one of those people but very much you. You spot an open table...
