The Recap of session 5
The fight is over, time to debrief. [[Themodius]] explained that he found Nook randomly and followed her around to make sure the [[Noxmares]] stayed in line. [[Noxmares]] thrive off of nightmares and so they feasted off that negative energy from Nook. It's only been for a few weeks [[Themodius]] and her travelled together. He's also a pacifist because he's so old and couldn't be bothered. 

Nook reveals she was attacked by something she couldn't see at a festival months back. She doesn't know what happened but she woke up to everyone around her either being unconscious or dead and bystanders in shock at something she did. She ran away and postings about the Devil's Little Witch cropped up around the same time as her nightmares. The hunt began and she went to the only person she thought could help with the nightmares, Lady Sadine. From one witch to another, Lady Sadine told her to find those flowers. She doesn't have issues with going to Kitan, she felt it was only right for you helping her. She likes Elizabeth, though Elizabeth broke her promise to protect Nook and she's not yet forgiven her for it. Nook was never too close with the Queen, but she is weary of the King of Volcandor, King Namor. He kept asking about her book and powers, never understanding why. Her book is also an incredibly powerful magical item written by a legendary wizard. 

Kei pulled Nook aside and warned her about Casey and Amadeus as they are doing all of this for money. Nook thanked him and they bonded over their disappointment with adults. 

But once conversation died down, you all slept the night to recover, Goobus stealing her book multiple times before giving up because it always goes back to Nook. In the morning, you headed out for Kitan, making Elizabeth aware of when you'd arrive when you were close. You passed through Daleton, a seafaring city built on a massive bridge that spanned the whole length of the Sylriver. You passed around Silvaya, a tightly guarded city of wood elves with an enormous wall of impenetrable trees. Finally, you arrive at Kitan many days later.

Session 6
Purpose: Bring Nook to the Queen
##### The City

From the distance you see disecting the tree line, two massive aqueducts that cut through the forest from mountains peeking over the the horizon. 

*At the gates a few guards stand, welcoming this weird band of adventurers. They give inquisitive looks to the slime and shrub but Elizabeth steps forward past them, flanked by her own better dressed guards. She's playing a cheery song on her violin, a real masterwork instrument. It's base is made out of intricately carved wooden petals that sway as she plays, and each note sounds as if it's being carried by the wind straight to you. 

*Elizabeth will give everyone a warm welcome and give a big bow to Nook. Eliz will apologize to her and ensure security has been tightened but to let her know of any issues.


*She'll walk the party through the center of the city straight towards a large castle. On the way they see a number of complex roadways, sets of impossibly large aqueducts, and a beautiful mix of orange and blue rooftops. Kitan is busy, but in contrast to it all, you occasionally see buildings that have been broken down, seemingly violently, streets that almost appear to have been scorched long ago, and a few places with guards posted in front of them, quarantined off due to hazardous conditions inside. Near the center, a few townspeople are working hard to clean up one building, appears to be a bakery, collapsed and burned. Meanwhile in the busy center, market stalls, wagons, and wandering merchants upsell a variety of goods. It's a large open square, and it'd be difficult to navigate on horses with the crowd but Elizabeth and her men clear the path and cheer and praise can be heard for her. A mother hands her young son a rose who runs up to her and she graciously accepts "Aw, how'd you know roses were my favorite?" and he runs back with a big smile. "Play us a song!"

*"I was waitin for someone to ask!" Holding the rose stem in her mouth, she plays the same song from earlier. A number of bards within the crowd frantically pull out their instruments playing along, but her playing is clearly the loudest. A number of young women and men fall back in awe of her beautiful presence, one man who tries to get too close is pushed back by guards, the bouquet of roses he was holding flying upward towards you all.

*Needless to say the people love her. Roll notice. (To the highest rollers) You notice a number of figures in exceptionally mundane and dark clothes whisper to each other and point to you all. A human lady with black hair and eyes with white irises watches Nook intently, smiling but makes no moves.*

##### The castle
*Bouncing through a number of switchback streets, at the highest point of Kitan sits the castle. The walls surrounding it being made of large smooth white bricks, walls that feel as though they were built by giants. A portcullis opens to greet you all, guards in blue and gold, and oddly some red ones too? These red guards are speckled throughout and have uniforms entirely different from the Kitan guards, they themselves are generally larger too. Elizabeth waves off anyone coming to question you all, but all eyes stare at your strange group. Walking up the steps, you come across a set of large wooden doors and with a wave from Elizabeth, the guardsmen push the doors open. Elizabeth strides in.

Roseanne is awaiting them.

Roseanne will invite them all to eat and discuss the adventure. Namor will come in for a meal some time during the conversation
