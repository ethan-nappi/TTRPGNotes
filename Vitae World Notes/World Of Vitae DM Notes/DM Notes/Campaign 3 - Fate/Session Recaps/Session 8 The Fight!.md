Out of eye and ear shot of the party, we open with a scene from the edge of the audience. A woman in dark robes, unimpressed with the games begins to walk out. But slowly building up is a creepy smile. The illusion over her fades to reveal black eyes with white irises, and cracked skin. Many other figures outside seeing the woman walk out of the arena all disperse into the streets. As she walks, a cat approaches her.

"Oh my, another one of you?" Themodius says

*"What? Another one of you? How many Night Barons are cats?"*

"It's quite alarming you're surrounded by those things but yet you don't show any fear, in fact you seem happy about that?"

*"If you master your pain, fears, nightmares... what is there to worry about? Besides, if any step out of line, I have another one of you that can dispose of them."*

"Oh? And enlighten me, what's the name of this fine fellow?"

*"Does it make you nervous when I say, Nutcracker?"*

"No."

*"Interesting, I didn't know cats could sweat... and that they could lie!"*

The woman jumps at Themodius and we cut back to the fight.

Denouement
Liam - like non lethal fate combat, primary objective that isn't domination, makes zone based combat more interesting with alternate objectives, party is not psychopaths who actually feel the weight of killing someone
just saying no, is a good thing

Amanda - echoing Liam, everyone must die next session, twice (big joke)

sky -
