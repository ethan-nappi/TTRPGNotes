<h2 data-heading="Capability">Capability</h2>
<p>Nook is a <a data-href="Dragon Tamer" href="Dragon Tamer" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Tamer</a>, potentially the only one in <a data-href="Vitae" href="Vitae" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vitae</a>.</p>
<h2 data-heading="Mentality">Mentality</h2>
<h5 data-heading="EDUCATION">EDUCATION</h5>
<p>Most of Nook's education comes from <a data-href="Nawvel" href="Nawvel" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nawvel</a> and is also from self teaching. Nawvel sat with her in the orphanage teaching her some of the things he was learning in school until she could attend it herself. She was always above her grade level in learning but scored low on tests due to the mental strain of bullying from classmates. She left before the end of her second year and stuck solely to self-teaching.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Currently she learns the basic subjects herself and recieves deeper, more thorough teaching in the arcane and science from Nawvel.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Nook also teaches herself fighting techniques with her dagger and crossbow in case anything ever goes awry.</p>
<h5 data-heading="ACCOMPLISHMENTS">ACCOMPLISHMENTS</h5>
<p>Although currently too young, she has received recommendations from Nawvel to the <a data-href="Aspirit Guild" href="Aspirit Guild" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aspirit Guild</a>, a guild she looks to join.</p>
<h5 data-heading="MENTAL TRAUMA">MENTAL TRAUMA</h5>
<p>Nook has endured much bullying from children at the orphanage and in school as well as discrimination from shopkeeps and guardsmen.</p>
<h5 data-heading="INTELLECT">INTELLECT</h5>
<p>Nook is an incredibly quick learner and it is unsure if this has anything to do with her odd draconic bloodline. She is also almost supernaturally charismatic.</p>
<h5 data-heading="MORALITY &amp; PHILOSOPHY">MORALITY &amp; PHILOSOPHY</h5>
<p>Nook was taught by <a data-href="Nawvel" href="Nawvel" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nawvel</a> and the books she read as a kid to be good, although she's still figuring it all out.</p>
<h5 data-heading="KNOWN LANGUAGES">KNOWN LANGUAGES</h5>
<p>Nook can speak a number of languages thanks to <a data-href="Nawvel" href="Nawvel" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nawvel</a>. She can speak: Dwarvish, Draconic, Infernal,&nbsp;████, and Common</p>
<h2 data-heading="Personality">Personality</h2>
<h5 data-heading="LIKES &amp; DISLIKES">LIKES &amp; DISLIKES</h5>
<p>Nook loves to learn about the world, history, the arcane, dragons, and any subject she hasn't tapped into yet. Nook also loves the colors purple and pink.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Nook doesn't have any particular dislikes.</p>
<h5 data-heading="VIRTUES &amp; PERSONALITY PERKS">VIRTUES &amp; PERSONALITY PERKS</h5>
<p>Despite enduring a lot of hardship, Nook can keep a calm exterior and can brush off little troubles, staying optimistic when all is well.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
She remains very curious, asking many questions and wanting to get into the tiny details of things.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
She's yet to have bound herself to any code, so she'll go with any idea or plan that doesn't involve harm to anyone.</p>
<h5 data-heading="VICES &amp; PERSONALITY FLAWS">VICES &amp; PERSONALITY FLAWS</h5>
<p>Nook more often than not will keep to herself and won't speak when there's an issue. She is still very unsure of how to deal with her emotions, letting them bottle up and eventually quickly letting it all go in an explosive manner if not resolved.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Nook also cannot bring herself to hurt a dragon, even when it attacks her.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Due to her age, she can also be easily influenced by what goes on around her, potentially leading her to pick up on bad behaviors.</p>
<h2 data-heading="Social">Social</h2>
<h5 data-heading="CONTACTS &amp; RELATIONS">CONTACTS &amp; RELATIONS</h5>
<p>Nook only has a relation to Nawvel, treating him as a close friend and mentor.<br>

<h5 data-heading="MANNERISMS">MANNERISMS</h5>
<p>Nook's speech fluctuates a lot with her mood and with who she's talking to. She adapts quickly to match the mannerisms of who she's speaking to, sometimes mimicking posture and hand motions. Generally, she is very expressive.</p>
