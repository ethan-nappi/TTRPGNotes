Eku (past) - elven girl belonging to a rich family, reached about age 20 before she was put in “the box” (i never picked a subrace, open to suggestions)
  
Eku (present) - Reborn divine sorcerer, she hides the fact she’s a reborn, she calls herself just a normal elf, she’s never told anyone this, age 13 and a half
  
Celesti - fake last name gave to her by The Fearsome 90, it just means celestial
  
Arreign - the last name she had from her last life, her family name, she learned this shortly before she turned 13
  
Her divine magic - :shrug: make it up! Here’s a list of ideas I’m chill with and think would be cool but don’t tell me what you pick:
-   A god blessed a group of elves with godly magic, this was a recessive trait that ended up in Eku
-   A group of elves performed a ritual to create their own god, Eku was the result
-   Eku was the child of a god that was hidden on the material plane from the other gods, the Arreign were the first to find her
-   An entire cities’ belief in one perfect person was enough to make a god
-   A city needed a hero to save them from a great doom and gave powers to the highest bidder, the Arreign’s bid couldn’t be matched

Ekalsta - Eku’s hometown (happy to change this to a place in ur world), this place was attacked and pillaged of all its worth
  
The mansion - (present) Eku’s home, where “the box” is located, where the constructs are located, located in Ekalsta, the constructs are from here and took care of Eku’s every need to grow, there are 20 constructs (happy to change this to an orphanage or foster home she ended up in)
  
“The box” - a magical box made of lead that takes someone placed inside and rebirths them at another point as a baby (note that reborn don't need food or water)

The Fearsome 90 - her first adventuring group, there are five total in the group (including Eku), Eku saved them on their last quest, (Eku would’ve been 11 yrs old) they last put adventuring on hiatus, Eku has never checked on them

Brewt Force (my previous dnd group) - an adventuring group she was with for some time that I’ll recall stories from (like the time she beat a dwarven prince in a drinking contest), she was with them when she was 12 and a half, she left at 13

Embedded in Eku's skin is [[Mysterious Ore]]

[[The Fetid Moors]] - Eku's biome of origin

# Full backstory

In the rich elven city of Ekalsta, there existed an elven girl by the name of Eku. She was the most beloved and cared for person in the city. She needed to be as she contained divine energy that could have only been sourced from the gods. She never needed to worry about sickness, hunger, poverty, boredom, she was living the best that could’ve been given to her.

Only a few memories remain of this past life for Eku: a few parties, dancing, powerful magic and a sea of knowledge. Though context and detail escapes her. What she remembers last from her past life is the city and her family rushing to get her into a secret chamber. There was fire, smoke, rumbling and sounds loud as thunder in the distance. She was never told what was happening. She was placed into a box, shaped like a coffin for someone double her size and the lid was shut on her after many tearful goodbyes. 

Nothing but pure darkness and silence existed for an infinite amount of time. In her mind replayed the memories of a past life she didn’t understand. When she awoke, she was inside of her box. She was awake, but couldn’t sense anything but the feeling of the walls around her and the sound of her breath. She swears she breathed fifty million times before the lid on her box opened.

She was greeted by constructs who quickly all introduced themselves to her. There were twenty. The box had been moved, and it was moved into a mansion that had almost everything she needed. Food, water, shelter, knowledge, and those twenty constructs that served exclusively her. She named each one, spent all her time reading stories and practicing fighting against the constructs. She accidentally casted a spell during training and realized the energy flowing through her. This made her believe she had some legendary powers that needed to be unlocked and unleashed. She honed those skills for some months before she felt limited in the house, so she explored the city outside. 

The city was long abandoned, looted of all its worth, and in ruin. Eku felt very comfortable walking around inside the husk of the city, it felt familiar and could sense the greatness and pride that used to exist here, long lost. She would steal what books remained, mostly children’s books, and continue her self-taught learning. Most of the books told of grand adventurers, heroes, legends, and their triumphs and tragedies. This being the only knowledge of the outside world she had, she wanted to experience the same as they did. 

After great consideration (which was a consideration that lasted about a minute, the longest time she’s spent thinking about anything), she decided she wanted to leave the city for good, in pursuit of greatness and glory. She grabbed as much paper and writing utensils as possible and lit fires in the center of the city, a signal for great adventurers to come her way. One day, strangers knocked on her door, a group of adventurers. They noticed the smoke and came to check out what was going on. When Eku explained she needed safe travels to the nearest city, the adventurers happily took her along. 

They were known as The Fearsome 90, despite there only being four in the group. They claimed it was to make them sound way more scary and bigger than they really were, it also looked good on their resumes as they labeled themselves as Lead Fighter, Lead Cleric, Lead Archer, and Lead Witch. Eku would hang around them for almost a year before they took on a quest that quickly went out of hand.

The quest detailed Orsholi (goblin) in an abandoned mine. However, the person who wrote out the quest was a large Yelari (firbolg) who didn't truly know how small Orsholi (goblin) were and the real inhabitants of the mine were Solesi (orc). Unprepared, the adventurers got seriously wounded but Eku, who always remained back, saw her moment to shine and saved the crew with a slew of radiant spells the crew had never seen before. Healing words, guiding bolts, and fire lit up the room, burning the Solesi (orc) away in terror before they could finish off her friends.

She was regarded as a hero to them, and quickly they decided to give an answer to a question she had for a long time. They appointed her Lead Sorceress and started calling her Eku Celesti, because every hero deserves a last name that can strike fear into any enemy that knows its meaning. As well, they handed her a big journal to write down her adventures in, to one day publish her story of heroism to the world. 

Unfortunately for Eku, she had to soon leave the party as the last adventure shook them up too much and they needed time to recover from their injuries. After a few long goodbyes, Yorge, the Lead Cleric, led her to a nearby temple of his god, the sun god. He felt her divine magic was tied to the gods but it was only a guess.

After her final farewell to Yorge, she hung around priests and clerics in that temple and the ones nearby, absorbing everything about the gods. It quickly led her to researching legends and heroes of the past, looking for their connections with the gods. She traveled vast distances, stayed overnight at libraries and temples, and jumped around some more adventuring groups.

In some dusty books in the back of a library, she found a book that had a small bit of history on Ekalsta and included the family name “Arreign,” a wealthy family that owned the mansion she was reborn in. Therefore, she adopted the new name “Eku Celesti-Arreign.”

Now in her best guess of thirteen and a half years old, she’s found a new band of heroes to travel around with, one she hopes she can write a great tale for.**
